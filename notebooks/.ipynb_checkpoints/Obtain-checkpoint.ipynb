    "1. What is the problem to be addressed?\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "During the 2016 US presidential election, journalists began noticing a rash of viral made-up stories on Facebook.\n",
    "Bizarrely, many of the pages appeared to be posted by people from the Balkans and after BuzzFeed reported on an unusual cluster of pages, reporters flocked to a small town called Veles in Macedonia.\n",
    "Social media platforms where fake news is shared has come under intense criticism for the role its popular tools have played in amplifying violence, which has happened in Myanmar and other parts of the world.\n",
    "The problem of fake news detection is more challenging than detecting deceptive reviews, since the political language on TV interviews, posts on Facebook and Twitter are mostly short statements. However, the lack of manually labeled fake news dataset is still a bottleneck for advancing computational-intensive, broadcoverage models in this direction.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "1. What is the question that I am trying to answer?\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Based only on surface-level linguistic realizations, how well can machine learning algorithms classify a short statement into a fine-grained category of fakeness?\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "2. What are the possible challenges?\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Facebook and Google’s sizable machine learning divisions have created algorithms that effectively surface information that users want to see. But they’ve been unable to actually understand or vet that info—and in fact, experts across the tech industry say it’s unrealistic to expect any AI or machine learning algorithm to do this task well. And no matter how good the algorithm, if it is trained by humans, it will inevitably take on some biases.\n",
    "Another challenge is who decides whether an article is credible or not? Currently it is on the audience. But can we rely entirely on audience to generate that insight?"

       "      <td>“Senator Johnny Isakson fought President Obama’s reckless deal with the Iranian regime. Now Iran is already violating the agreement — illegally testing ballistic missiles, threatening Israel and supporting terrorism in the Middle East.”\\n\\nThis ad begins with Isakson, who is running for his third Senate term, saying: “I voted against the nuclear deal with Iran for a ton of reasons.” Then, a narrator claims that Iran is already violating the agreement, which the senator opposed, by illegally testing ballistic missiles. (We spotted this ad on the website of our partners, Political TV Ad Archive.) Is that really the case? We did some digging.\\n\\nThe formal name for the deal reached in July between Iran and world powers, including the United States, is the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), commonly called the “Iran deal.”\\n\\nIsakson, member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, opposed the deal. But Senate Republicans failed to advance legislation that would have allowed them to reject the agreement.\\n\\nThe agreement was aimed at curbing Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for relief from international sanctions. After the deal was reached, the United Nations Security Council — which had imposed sanctions on Iran to pressure it to negotiate — adopted Resolution 2231. The resolution endorsed the deal and outlined conditions under which sanctions are to be lifted. Under the resolution, ballistic missile restrictions expire after eight years.\\n\\nThis is an important point in the context of Isakson’s ad: The Iran deal is not the same as U.N. Security Council Resolution 2231.\\n\\nThe nuclear agreement was officially implemented this January, after the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) certified that Iran had complied with all the nuclear-related measures it agreed to in July. Yet Iran has continued to test ballistic missiles and said it will not stop.\\n\\nThe deal does not prohibit the testing or development of ballistic missiles. But the U.N. resolution does contain restrictions relating to ballistic missiles. So how is Iran able to continue its testing? Experts say the resolution’s language allows Iran to argue that its ballistic missiles do not fit within the restrictions laid out in Resolution 2231.\\n\\nPrevious U.N. resolutions had stated that the council “decides that Iran shall not undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons.” The new resolution states “Iran is called upon not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using such ballistic missile technology.”\\n\\nThe language change from “decides that Iran shall not” to “Iran is called upon” represents a softening in tone, signaling a more non-legally-binding appeal. This change was made precisely because the Iran deal does not contain any limits on the country’s missile programs, said Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey.\\n\\n“It is perfectly respectable for opponents of the agreement to object to the Iran deal on these grounds — the JCPOA removes missile-related sanctions without requiring Iran to limit its missile programs,” Lewis said. “This was the hardest part of the agreement for me to accept, even if that sanctions relief only occurs after eight years.”\\n\\nFurther, the new resolution refers to missiles “designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons,” rather than “capable” of such delivery. So Iran now argues that its missiles are not “designed” for such capability.\\n\\n“If one finds that the missiles used are designed for nuclear weapon delivery, it appears to me that there will evidently be also a problem with the compliance with the JCPOA, which bans weaponization activities,” said Olli Heinonen, who led the IAEA’s safeguards section during the 2003-2005 talks between Iran and three European powers (Britain, France and Germany).\\n\\nThat argument is possible but will be difficult to prove, experts say. A legal determination hasn’t been made one way or the other, meaning that the testing is not yet a violation of the Iran deal.\\n\\nThe Isakson ad claims that Iran is “already violating the agreement” through these missile tests. The citation in the ad is an op-ed in U.S. News and World Report that Iran’s missile tests highlight weaknesses in the nuclear deal.\\n\\nThe senator’s staff pointed to news articles describing the tests as a violation of the U.N. resolution. They noted that President Obama had accused Iran of going against the “spirit” of the nuclear agreement, as he did at an April news conference:\\n\\nBut the ad itself does not say that Iran’s actions violate the “spirit” of the deal or that it violates the U.N. resolution. It says Iran is violating the agreement that Isakson opposed. That agreement would be the Iran deal, not the U.N. resolution.\\n\\n“There’s frustration [over the testing], and we have to look for effective policy tools to impede Iran’s missile program. But none of those tools, unfortunately, is the ability to say this is a violation of the Iran nuclear deal,” said Robert Einhorn, senior fellow at Brookings Institution and former special adviser on arms control and nonproliferation at the State Department.\\n\\nEinhorn added that it’s difficult to use the Security Council resolution as a policy tool, because Russia and China are reluctant to view missile tests as a violation of, or inconsistent with, the resolution.\\n\\nIsakson’s ad is about the Iran deal and his opposition to it. It claims that Iran is “already violating” the nuclear agreement by illegally testing ballistic missiles. Yet the actual deal did not have restrictions on ballistic missiles testing. Instead, the U.N. resolution that implements the deal contains the language. A range of experts we consulted said that the testing could be argued as violating the Iran deal but that it will be difficult. It’s an important technical distinction that is not reflected in the ad, ultimately misleading viewers. Moreover, it’s a matter of interpretation as to whether the testing is “illegal” under the resolution.\\n\\nWe understand that it’s probably not as catchy for a narrator in a campaign ad to say, “Western leaders view Iran’s missile tests as a violation of the U.N. resolution passed in tandem” or that the testing is “inconsistent with the spirit of the Iran deal.” But both of those phrases are accurate, and are certainly preferable to the sweeping, inaccurate claim in the ad.\\n\\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\\n\\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter</td>\n",

       "      <td>President Obama on Tuesday followed through on his vow to veto bipartisan-backed legislation authorizing the Keystone XL pipeline, marking his first veto of the Republican-led Congress and only the third of his presidency.\\n\\nThe president, in a brief statement, claimed the bill would \"circumvent\" the existing process for reviewing the pipeline, which would extend from Canada to Texas.\\n\\n\"The Presidential power to veto legislation is one I take seriously,\" Obama said. \"But I also take seriously my responsibility to the American people. And because this act of Congress conflicts with established executive branch procedures and cuts short thorough consideration of issues that could bear on our national interest -- including our security, safety, and environment -- it has earned my veto.\"\\n\\nThe decision, while expected, was met with tough criticism from Republicans -- and tees up another showdown with Congress in the coming days as GOP leaders try to override.\\n\\n\"It's extremely disappointing that President Obama vetoed a bipartisan bill that would support thousands of good jobs and pump billions of dollars into the economy,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said in a statement. \"Even though the President has yielded to powerful special interests, this veto doesn't end the debate.\"\\n\\nMcConnell's office said the Senate plans to vote on overriding sometime before March 3.\\n\\nBut so far, congressional leaders have not demonstrated they have the votes to override, which takes a two-thirds majority in both chambers.\\n\\nThe Keystone bill garnered 62 yeas in the Senate, but they would need 67 to override. In the House, the bill got 270 votes -- but they would need 281 to override.\\n\\nIt remains unclear whether moderate lawmakers could be swayed to switch in the coming weeks.\\n\\nWhile Tuesday's veto marked only the third of Obama's presidency -- fewer than any U.S. president since the 19th century -- his sparing use of the presidential tool is likely to change. With Republicans now in control of Congress, their efforts to chip away at the president's health care law and other legislative accomplishments are just as likely to be met with Obama's veto pen.\\n\\nTo date, Obama rarely has used the veto in part because Democrats for six years controlled at least one chamber in Congress -- acting as a buffer to prevent unwanted bills from ever reaching the president's desk. That buffer is now gone.\\n\\nA look back at past presidencies, especially where control of the White House and Congress was split during at least one point, shows far more liberal use of that presidential power.\\n\\nIn the Clinton presidency, the president issued 37 vetoes in his two terms. President Ronald Reagan issued 78. President George W. Bush issued 12. His father issued 44.\\n\\nNot since the Warren G. Harding administration has the number of vetoes been in the single digits; Harding issued six.\\n\\nThe Keystone bill is as contentious an issue as any for Obama to fire his first veto shot of the new Congress.\\n\\nFirst proposed in 2008, the Keystone pipeline would connect Canada's tar sands to Gulf Coast refineries.\\n\\nThe White House has said repeatedly it would wait to make its decision about whether to let the project go forward until after a State Department review. It regards the legislation as circumventing that process.\\n\\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Do Democrats Want What Bernie Wants, Or Just What Bernie Has?\\n\\nFor some weeks now, as Bernie Sanders has extended his remarkable and improbable run as a presidential candidate, people have been asking: \"What does Bernie want?\"\\n\\nThat question is a distant echo of \"What does Jesse want?\" a relic of the 1988 runner-up candidacy of Jesse Jackson, another \"outsider\" challenger with a dedicated hardcore following. But more about Jackson in a moment.\\n\\nThis week, the question took a different form. After a rowdy convention in Nevada prompted death threats against that state party chair, the question suddenly became: \"Are the Democrats coming apart?\"\\n\\nUniting for the fall has always been an issue for both parties. But this year, it was supposed to be the Republicans, with their 17 candidates and their frustrated #NeverTrump rearguard action, who broke up over their differences.\\n\\nNow, it's working out quite differently. So we hear again that old nostrum: \"Democrats want to fall in love, Republicans want to fall in line.\" A remarkable number of Republicans have accepted, if not embraced, Donald Trump as their nominee. But a large contingent of Democrats continue to feel the Bern, or at least remain very much out of love with Hillary Clinton.\\n\\nWhich brings us to this past weekend, which proved that sometimes what happens in Vegas does not stay in Vegas.\\n\\nThe \"Nevada fracas\" has created a media meme and a conversational focus for the conflict roiling the Democratic Party. That is because it encapsulates the grievances felt on both sides.\\n\\nSanders supporters see that some of their number were not seated in Las Vegas and see evidence that the system is rigged against them. Clinton supporters hear the epithets hurled at women on that stage, including the state party chair and Sen. Barbara Boxer, and perceive evidence of something else.\\n\\nOthers will adjudicate what happened in Las Vegas, where both candidates' camps seem to think they were entitled to a majority of delegates. (Although Clinton won the initial round of caucuses back in February, Sanders had the upper hand in an intermediate round at the county level on April 2.)\\n\\nOne camp wanted an open process; the other wanted respect for the rules. A voice vote was gaveled to a conclusion despite an uncertain outcome, which is bound to cause trouble. But in the end, the party chair herself has come to seem the principal victim — \"more sinned against than sinning\" — because of extreme phone and online harassment.\\n\\nNevada's convention seems to have been an egregious case, an outlier. In other states where actual delegates are chosen in several phases, regular order has been followed without a similar outburst.\\n\\nBut exceptions to the rule often make news. And in this case, cable TV and social media have endlessly repeated the raucous video shot at the convention and the toxic harassment that followed. As Nevada became a national story, Sanders was pressured to respond.\\n\\nThe candidate has condemned violence generically, but has not apologized for his backers. Instead, Sanders and his retinue have denied responsibility for what happened and doubled down on their long-simmering resentments against Democratic Party officials.\\n\\nThey say the entire process has been rigged against them, even parts that have been in place for decades. And the implicit message has been: Treat us fairly or expect there to be consequences. When this message is combined with Sanders' vow this week to \"carry our fight to the convention,\" it darkens the portents for the national convention in Philadelphia.\\n\\nSo what does Bernie want?\\n\\nLet's start with the obvious: He wants to be nominated and elected. That's understood. Every candidate has a perfect right to continue fighting until the last ballot is cast, as Sanders vows to do.\\n\\nBut even if he wins California, and several other states on June 7, Sanders would need vertiginous victory margins to win enough delegates to close the pledged delegate gap with Clinton. (The Democrats divide delegates proportionally according to the popular vote, which is just about as democratic a method as you can imagine.)\\n\\nSo Sanders' one path is to persuade superdelegates to prefer him over Clinton, even though they currently prefer Clinton by more than 10-1. (The only superdelegate to flip so far deserted Sanders for the front-runner.)\\n\\nSanders and his spokespersons say superdelegates should now ignore the overall vote and the pledged delegate totals and look at how much better Sanders does against Trump in hypothetical November matchups.\\n\\nThe only problem is that hypothetical tests six months before the election are notoriously unreliable. Just ask President Perot.\\n\\nMoreover, many of the poll respondents who create this November differential right now are Sanders supporters who say they will shift to Trump in November. The likelihood of their actually doing so is problematic, given past experience with disgruntled backers of other candidates who fell short. (The most recent example would be the Clinton backers in 2008 who swore they would not vote for the man who beat her, Barack Obama, but wound up doing so in the fall.)\\n\\nSo the \"path to the nomination\" for Sanders is not just uphill, it is essentially vertical.\\n\\nSo what else might Sanders want?\\n\\nNo one seems to think Sanders wants to be vice president or have any other role in a Clinton administration. He would return to the Senate, where he would be in a wholly new weight class of political influence.\\n\\nBut he clearly wants to make a difference, to alter how the Democrats go forward in the fall campaign and beyond.\\n\\nAnd that is what the Clinton camp must manage. It is entirely possible that the Democratic convention in Philadelphia this July will vote to change party rules, shrinking the number of superdelegates or requiring them to follow the voting results in their states.\\n\\nIt is also possible, if less likely, that the party would agree to allow more independents a role in its nominating process (although this would still depend on the will of the various states).\\n\\nSanders supporters will also strive to make the party platform more progressive, raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour and expanding Medicare to cover people of all ages and perhaps calling for free tuition at public colleges. (The platform already calls for much of Sanders' program regarding the campaign finance system and other issues.)\\n\\nThis might fall far short of the \"political revolution\" Sanders says his campaign is about. But it could still matter. And it could still point the party toward a far more progressive future.\\n\\nThat is one way in which the 1988 precedent is relevant. Jesse Jackson arrived in Atlanta with about 30 percent of the delegates (not nearly as many as Sanders will have this summer). At the time, it was easily the best showing for an African-American presidential candidate. And although Jackson was not going to be nominated (Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis had a first-ballot majority), his message of racial and economic inclusion was popular and powerful within the party's base.\\n\\nThe Dukakis forces recognized this and turned the proceedings over to Jackson on the second night of the convention. Thousands of Jackson supporters jammed the arena while delegates, alternates and journalists waited outside — unable to enter. Jackson gave an hourlong oration on the theme of common ground, a siege gun speaking for unity.\\n\\nJackson did his part in the fall, helping Dukakis carry nearly 90 percent of the black vote and 70 percent of the then-minuscule Hispanic vote. Unfortunately for Dukakis, minority voters cast only about one ballot in seven in 1988.\\n\\nBut by 2012, the share of the vote cast by people of color had nearly doubled. That stunning growth has turned a dozen states that were red in 1988 to blue in 2012 (California, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Michigan, New Jersey, Virginia, Maryland, New Mexico, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Delaware and Vermont).\\n\\nThe same demographic trends have made Florida, Ohio and Colorado toss-ups in presidential elections. All had been solidly Republican in 1988.\\n\\nSanders' hard base is not among minorities, of course, but among younger voters. His success has been built on winning three-fourths or even more of the voters under age 30. That is a group Clinton will need in the fall just as much as Dukakis needed Jackson's base in 1988.\\n\\nSanders may not want a Jackson-style prime-time convention session all his own. He might be willing to settle for platform and rules revisions that would validate his campaign. But if he wants a Bernie night in Philadelphia when he can bring his political revolution to life — even for a few hours — it might be a small price to pay for peace.</td>\n",

We fight terrorism,\" Lavrov said.\\n\\nLavrov questioned the U.S.-led coalition's legitimacy, given the mission had not received the consent of the U.N. Security Council or any \"request of one of the countries on whose territories they operate.\"\\n\\n\"You cannot avoid the impression that the legal basis of the coalition activities in Syria is really flawed,\" he said.\\n\\n\"As far as I understand, the coalition announced ISIL and other associated groups as the enemy and the coalition does the same as Russia [does]. Somehow some people try to present the coalition action as leading to a political settlement and Russia fighting the same people is being perceived or presented like defending the regime. It's absolutely unfair,\" he said.\\n\\nThe foreign minister also questioned the logic of trying to topple al-Assad to further the fight against ISIS, asking whether the removal of Saddam Hussein in Iraq and Moammar Gadhafi in Libya had made those countries better places.\\n\\nRussia's Defense Ministry issued a statement earlier Thursday saying that it had carried out new airstrikes.\\n\\n\"Russian Aerospace Forces engaged another four #ISIS facilities in #Syria this night,\" the Ministry announced on Twitter along with gun camera video showing large explosions.\\n\\nThe strikes were carried out by eight Russian SU-24 and SU-25 jets, which claimed to hit ISIS \"terrorist staff\" and an ammunition dump near Idlib and another headquarters in Hama.\\n\\nBut 24 hours into the military campaign, there were concerns it was targeting those who oppose al-Assad, including more moderate factions that are supported by the United States and others in the West.\\n\\nThe Syrian Ambassador to Russia, Riad Haddad, told CNN's Matthew Chance that Russians were fighting alongside the Syrians, to destroy not just ISIS but all of the other rebel groups in Syria.\\n\\nHaddad said all of the rebel groups, including ISIS, have a common goal: \"to spread terror.\"\\n\\nHe told CNN that the impact of the Russian airstrikes over the past few days has been more effective than all of the coalition airstrikes so far combined and that the Syrian army and the Russian army are working side by side, sharing intelligence and data and working very closely together.\\n\\nA Syrian opposition activist living north of Homs near one of the villages targeted -- Talbiseh -- told CNN that ISIS had no presence in the area.\\n\\n\"Russian warplanes were targeting civilians and innocent people only, Putin is lying about targeting Daesh militants,\" Khdaier Khushfa said via Skype. Daesh is another name for ISIS.\\n\\n\"Daesh withdrew from the northern countryside of Homs in an announcement they made a year ago after the groups refused to deal with them, including Ahrar al Sham and Revolutionaries Front,\" he said.\\n\\n\"We know that Russia is the biggest ally of the Syrian regime, and since Bashar al-Assad considers us terrorists, then there is no doubt that Putin knows these areas are under our control and not Daesh.\"\\n\\nKhushfa said the Russian strikes had killed 17 civilians in Talbiseh and 11 in Zafaraniya, despite rebel military posts and headquarters being located outside the two villages.\\n\\n\"We are used to the regime airstrikes but now the entire world is watching another country killing civilians in cold blood without taking any action,\" he said. \"We are very concerned about what will happen next -- civilians I spoke to are very scared -- it's like, after five years since the revolution started we are back to ground zero.\"\\n\\nU.S. officials have also questioned whether ISIS is active in the areas hit by the Russian strikes.\\n\\nSen. John McCain -- chairman of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee -- told CNN's Chris Cuomo that he could \"absolutely confirm\" that the initial strikes were \"against our Free Syrian Army or groups that have been armed and trained by the CIA, because we have communications with people there.\"\\n\\nMcCain called the Russian strikes \"an incredible flouting of any kind of cooperation or effort to conceal what their first -- Putin's priority is. And that is of course to prop up Bashar al-Assad.\"\\n\\nDefense Secretary Ash Carter said Wednesday that the Russian attacks, which the Kremlin said were meant to target terrorists, didn't appear to hit targets under the control of ISIS, which operates in the north and east of the country.\\n\\nBut the White House downplayed the dangers of the Russian move.\\n\\n\"I think the Russians have made clear that they're not interested in provoking a conflict,\" White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said. \"Their actions thus far indicate that that's what they believe.\"\\n\\nThe U.S. and Russian military will hold a secure video teleconference call Thursday. The U.S. will be represented by Elissa Slotkin, assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs, and Vice Adm. Frank Craig Pandolfe, director of strategic plans and policy on the Joint Staff, according to the Pentagon.\\n\\nThe Iraqi Prime Minister welcomed Russia's involvement in the fight against ISIS.\\n\\nFor that reason, al-Abadi said, Iraq appreciated anyone willing to join the fight.\\n\\n\"Our message to the Russians -- I met with Putin -- please join this fight against Da'esh,\" he said, using another name for ISIS. \"Da'esh is a dangerous terrorist organization, not only against Iraq, against Syria, against the whole region, against the whole world. It is time that we all join the same forces to fight Da'esh.\"\\n\\nIn his comments at the United Nations, Lavrov said that Russia had no plans to move its operations into Iraq.\\n\\n\"No we are not planning to expand our airstrikes to Iraq,\" he said. We are polite people -- we don't come if we are not invited.\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, the Israel Defense Forces said Thursday that senior defense officials from Israel and Russia are scheduled to meet next Tuesday in Tel Aviv to address the coordination between the two militaries in the region. Israel's deputy chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Yair Golan, along with his Russian counterpart Maj. Gen. Nikolai Bogdanovski, are to meet at the Kirya Base in Tel Aviv, the IDF said.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Donald Trump a KGB Spy? 11/02/2016 In today’s video, Christopher Greene of AMTV reports Hillary Clinton campaign accusation that Donald Trump is a KGB spy is about as weak and baseless a claim as a Salem witch hunt or McCarthy era trial. It’s only because Hillary Clinton is losing that she is lobbing conspiracy theory. Citizen Quasar \\nThe way I see it, one of two things will happen: \\n1. Trump will win by a landslide but the election will be stolen via electronic voting, just like I have been predicting for over a decade, and the American People will accept the skewed election results just like they accept the TSA into their crotches. \\n2.

       "2321  “Senator Johnny Isakson fought President Obama’s reckless deal with the Iranian regime. Now Iran is already violating the agreement — illegally testing ballistic missiles, threatening Israel and supporting terrorism in the Middle East.”\\n\\nThis ad begins with Isakson, who is running for his third Senate term, saying: “I voted against the nuclear deal with Iran for a ton of reasons.” Then, a narrator claims that Iran is already violating the agreement, which the senator opposed, by illegally testing ballistic missiles. (We spotted this ad on the website of our partners, Political TV Ad Archive.) Is that really the case? We did some digging.\\n\\nThe formal name for the deal reached in July between Iran and world powers, including the United States, is the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), commonly called the “Iran deal.”\\n\\nIsakson, member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, opposed the deal. But Senate Republicans failed to advance legislation that would have allowed them to reject the agreement.\\n\\nThe agreement was aimed at curbing Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for relief from international sanctions. After the deal was reached, the United Nations Security Council — which had imposed sanctions on Iran to pressure it to negotiate — adopted Resolution 2231. The resolution endorsed the deal and outlined conditions under which sanctions are to be lifted. Under the resolution, ballistic missile restrictions expire after eight years.\\n\\nThis is an important point in the context of Isakson’s ad: The Iran deal is not the same as U.N. Security Council Resolution 2231.\\n\\nThe nuclear agreement was officially implemented this January, after the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) certified that Iran had complied with all the nuclear-related measures it agreed to in July. Yet Iran has continued to test ballistic missiles and said it will not stop.\\n\\nThe deal does not prohibit the testing or development of ballistic missiles. But the U.N. resolution does contain restrictions relating to ballistic missiles. So how is Iran able to continue its testing? Experts say the resolution’s language allows Iran to argue that its ballistic missiles do not fit within the restrictions laid out in Resolution 2231.\\n\\nPrevious U.N. resolutions had stated that the council “decides that Iran shall not undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons.” The new resolution states “Iran is called upon not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using such ballistic missile technology.”\\n\\nThe language change from “decides that Iran shall not” to “Iran is called upon” represents a softening in tone, signaling a more non-legally-binding appeal. This change was made precisely because the Iran deal does not contain any limits on the country’s missile programs, said Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey.\\n\\n“It is perfectly respectable for opponents of the agreement to object to the Iran deal on these grounds — the JCPOA removes missile-related sanctions without requiring Iran to limit its missile programs,” Lewis said. “This was the hardest part of the agreement for me to accept, even if that sanctions relief only occurs after eight years.”\\n\\nFurther, the new resolution refers to missiles “designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons,” rather than “capable” of such delivery. So Iran now argues that its missiles are not “designed” for such capability.\\n\\n“If one finds that the missiles used are designed for nuclear weapon delivery, it appears to me that there will evidently be also a problem with the compliance with the JCPOA, which bans weaponization activities,” said Olli Heinonen, who led the IAEA’s safeguards section during the 2003-2005 talks between Iran and three European powers (Britain, France and Germany).\\n\\nThat argument is possible but will be difficult to prove, experts say. A legal determination hasn’t been made one way or the other, meaning that the testing is not yet a violation of the Iran deal.\\n\\nThe Isakson ad claims that Iran is “already violating the agreement” through these missile tests. The citation in the ad is an op-ed in U.S. News and World Report that Iran’s missile tests highlight weaknesses in the nuclear deal.\\n\\nThe senator’s staff pointed to news articles describing the tests as a violation of the U.N. resolution. They noted that President Obama had accused Iran of going against the “spirit” of the nuclear agreement, as he did at an April news conference:\\n\\nBut the ad itself does not say that Iran’s actions violate the “spirit” of the deal or that it violates the U.N. resolution. It says Iran is violating the agreement that Isakson opposed. That agreement would be the Iran deal, not the U.N. resolution.\\n\\n“There’s frustration [over the testing], and we have to look for effective policy tools to impede Iran’s missile program. But none of those tools, unfortunately, is the ability to say this is a violation of the Iran nuclear deal,” said Robert Einhorn, senior fellow at Brookings Institution and former special adviser on arms control and nonproliferation at the State Department.\\n\\nEinhorn added that it’s difficult to use the Security Council resolution as a policy tool, because Russia and China are reluctant to view missile tests as a violation of, or inconsistent with, the resolution.\\n\\nIsakson’s ad is about the Iran deal and his opposition to it. It claims that Iran is “already violating” the nuclear agreement by illegally testing ballistic missiles. Yet the actual deal did not have restrictions on ballistic missiles testing. Instead, the U.N. resolution that implements the deal contains the language. A range of experts we consulted said that the testing could be argued as violating the Iran deal but that it will be difficult. It’s an important technical distinction that is not reflected in the ad, ultimately misleading viewers. Moreover, it’s a matter of interpretation as to whether the testing is “illegal” under the resolution.\\n\\nWe understand that it’s probably not as catchy for a narrator in a campaign ad to say, “Western leaders view Iran’s missile tests as a violation of the U.N. resolution passed in tandem” or that the testing is “inconsistent with the spirit of the Iran deal.” But both of those phrases are accurate, and are certainly preferable to the sweeping, inaccurate claim in the ad.\\n\\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\\n\\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "1672  President Obama on Tuesday followed through on his vow to veto bipartisan-backed legislation authorizing the Keystone XL pipeline, marking his first veto of the Republican-led Congress and only the third of his presidency.\\n\\nThe president, in a brief statement, claimed the bill would \"circumvent\" the existing process for reviewing the pipeline, which would extend from Canada to Texas.\\n\\n\"The Presidential power to veto legislation is one I take seriously,\" Obama said. \"But I also take seriously my responsibility to the American people. And because this act of Congress conflicts with established executive branch procedures and cuts short thorough consideration of issues that could bear on our national interest -- including our security, safety, and environment -- it has earned my veto.\"\\n\\nThe decision, while expected, was met with tough criticism from Republicans -- and tees up another showdown with Congress in the coming days as GOP leaders try to override.\\n\\n\"It's extremely disappointing that President Obama vetoed a bipartisan bill that would support thousands of good jobs and pump billions of dollars into the economy,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said in a statement. \"Even though the President has yielded to powerful special interests, this veto doesn't end the debate.\"\\n\\nMcConnell's office said the Senate plans to vote on overriding sometime before March 3.\\n\\nBut so far, congressional leaders have not demonstrated they have the votes to override, which takes a two-thirds majority in both chambers.\\n\\nThe Keystone bill garnered 62 yeas in the Senate, but they would need 67 to override. In the House, the bill got 270 votes -- but they would need 281 to override.\\n\\nIt remains unclear whether moderate lawmakers could be swayed to switch in the coming weeks.\\n\\nWhile Tuesday's veto marked only the third of Obama's presidency -- fewer than any U.S. president since the 19th century -- his sparing use of the presidential tool is likely to change. With Republicans now in control of Congress, their efforts to chip away at the president's health care law and other legislative accomplishments are just as likely to be met with Obama's veto pen.\\n\\nTo date, Obama rarely has used the veto in part because Democrats for six years controlled at least one chamber in Congress -- acting as a buffer to prevent unwanted bills from ever reaching the president's desk. That buffer is now gone.\\n\\nA look back at past presidencies, especially where control of the White House and Congress was split during at least one point, shows far more liberal use of that presidential power.\\n\\nIn the Clinton presidency, the president issued 37 vetoes in his two terms. President Ronald Reagan issued 78. President George W. Bush issued 12. His father issued 44.\\n\\nNot since the Warren G.

       "5414  Do Democrats Want What Bernie Wants, Or Just What Bernie Has?\\n\\nFor some weeks now, as Bernie Sanders has extended his remarkable and improbable run as a presidential candidate, people have been asking: \"What does Bernie want?\"\\n\\nThat question is a distant echo of \"What does Jesse want?\" a relic of the 1988 runner-up candidacy of Jesse Jackson, another \"outsider\" challenger with a dedicated hardcore following. But more about Jackson in a moment.\\n\\nThis week, the question took a different form. After a rowdy convention in Nevada prompted death threats against that state party chair, the question suddenly became: \"Are the Democrats coming apart?\"\\n\\nUniting for the fall has always been an issue for both parties. But this year, it was supposed to be the Republicans, with their 17 candidates and their frustrated #NeverTrump rearguard action, who broke up over their differences.\\n\\nNow, it's working out quite differently. So we hear again that old nostrum: \"Democrats want to fall in love, Republicans want to fall in line.\" A remarkable number of Republicans have accepted, if not embraced, Donald Trump as their nominee. But a large contingent of Democrats continue to feel the Bern, or at least remain very much out of love with Hillary Clinton.\\n\\nWhich brings us to this past weekend, which proved that sometimes what happens in Vegas does not stay in Vegas.\\n\\nThe \"Nevada fracas\" has created a media meme and a conversational focus for the conflict roiling the Democratic Party. That is because it encapsulates the grievances felt on both sides.\\n\\nSanders supporters see that some of their number were not seated in Las Vegas and see evidence that the system is rigged against them. Clinton supporters hear the epithets hurled at women on that stage, including the state party chair and Sen. Barbara Boxer, and perceive evidence of something else.\\n\\nOthers will adjudicate what happened in Las Vegas, where both candidates' camps seem to think they were entitled to a majority of delegates. (Although Clinton won the initial round of caucuses back in February, Sanders had the upper hand in an intermediate round at the county level on April 2.)\\n\\nOne camp wanted an open process; the other wanted respect for the rules. A voice vote was gaveled to a conclusion despite an uncertain outcome, which is bound to cause trouble. But in the end, the party chair herself has come to seem the principal victim — \"more sinned against than sinning\" — because of extreme phone and online harassment.\\n\\nNevada's convention seems to have been an egregious case, an outlier. In other states where actual delegates are chosen in several phases, regular order has been followed without a similar outburst.\\n\\nBut exceptions to the rule often make news. And in this case, cable TV and social media have endlessly repeated the raucous video shot at the convention and the toxic harassment that followed. As Nevada became a national story, Sanders was pressured to respond.\\n\\nThe candidate has condemned violence generically, but has not apologized for his backers. Instead, Sanders and his retinue have denied responsibility for what happened and doubled down on their long-simmering resentments against Democratic Party officials.\\n\\nThey say the entire process has been rigged against them, even parts that have been in place for decades. And the implicit message has been: Treat us fairly or expect there to be consequences. When this message is combined with Sanders' vow this week to \"carry our fight to the convention,\" it darkens the portents for the national convention in Philadelphia.\\n\\nSo what does Bernie want?\\n\\nLet's start with the obvious: He wants to be nominated and elected. That's understood. Every candidate has a perfect right to continue fighting until the last ballot is cast, as Sanders vows to do.\\n\\nBut even if he wins California, and several other states on June 7, Sanders would need vertiginous victory margins to win enough delegates to close the pledged delegate gap with Clinton. (The Democrats divide delegates proportionally according to the popular vote, which is just about as democratic a method as you can imagine.)\\n\\nSo Sanders' one path is to persuade superdelegates to prefer him over Clinton, even though they currently prefer Clinton by more than 10-1. (The only superdelegate to flip so far deserted Sanders for the front-runner.)\\n\\nSanders and his spokespersons say superdelegates should now ignore the overall vote and the pledged delegate totals and look at how much better Sanders does against Trump in hypothetical November matchups.\\n\\nThe only problem is that hypothetical tests six months before the election are notoriously unreliable. Just ask President Perot.\\n\\nMoreover, many of the poll respondents who create this November differential right now are Sanders supporters who say they will shift to Trump in November. The likelihood of their actually doing so is problematic, given past experience with disgruntled backers of other candidates who fell short. (The most recent example would be the Clinton backers in 2008 who swore they would not vote for the man who beat her, Barack Obama, but wound up doing so in the fall.)\\n\\nSo the \"path to the nomination\" for Sanders is not just uphill, it is essentially vertical.\\n\\nSo what else might Sanders want?\\n\\nNo one seems to think Sanders wants to be vice president or have any other role in a Clinton administration. He would return to the Senate, where he would be in a wholly new weight class of political influence.\\n\\nBut he clearly wants to make a difference, to alter how the Democrats go forward in the fall campaign and beyond.\\n\\nAnd that is what the Clinton camp must manage. It is entirely possible that the Democratic convention in Philadelphia this July will vote to change party rules, shrinking the number of superdelegates or requiring them to follow the voting results in their states.\\n\\nIt is also possible, if less likely, that the party would agree to allow more independents a role in its nominating process (although this would still depend on the will of the various states).\\n\\nSanders supporters will also strive to make the party platform more progressive, raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour and expanding Medicare to cover people of all ages and perhaps calling for free tuition at public colleges. (The platform already calls for much of Sanders' program regarding the campaign finance system and other issues.)\\n\\nThis might fall far short of the \"political revolution\" Sanders says his campaign is about. But it could still matter. And it could still point the party toward a far more progressive future.\\n\\nThat is one way in which the 1988 precedent is relevant. Jesse Jackson arrived in Atlanta with about 30 percent of the delegates (not nearly as many as Sanders will have this summer). At the time, it was easily the best showing for an African-American presidential candidate. And although Jackson was not going to be nominated (Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis had a first-ballot majority), his message of racial and economic inclusion was popular and powerful within the party's base.\\n\\nThe Dukakis forces recognized this and turned the proceedings over to Jackson on the second night of the convention. Thousands of Jackson supporters jammed the arena while delegates, alternates and journalists waited outside — unable to enter. Jackson gave an hourlong oration on the theme of common ground, a siege gun speaking for unity.\\n\\nJackson did his part in the fall, helping Dukakis carry nearly 90 percent of the black vote and 70 percent of the then-minuscule Hispanic vote. Unfortunately for Dukakis, minority voters cast only about one ballot in seven in 1988.\\n\\nBut by 2012, the share of the vote cast by people of color had nearly doubled. That stunning growth has turned a dozen states that were red in 1988 to blue in 2012 (California, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Michigan, New Jersey, Virginia, Maryland, New Mexico, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Delaware and Vermont).\\n\\nThe same demographic trends have made Florida, Ohio and Colorado toss-ups in presidential elections. All had been solidly Republican in 1988.\\n\\nSanders' hard base is not among minorities, of course, but among younger voters. His success has been built on winning three-fourths or even more of the voters under age 30. That is a group Clinton will need in the fall just as much as Dukakis needed Jackson's base in 1988.\\n\\nSanders may not want a Jackson-style prime-time convention session all his own. He might be willing to settle for platform and rules revisions that would validate his campaign. But if he wants a Bernie night in Philadelphia when he can bring his political revolution to life — even for a few hours — it might be a small price to pay for peace.   \n",
       "3674  (CNN) Russia's airstrikes in Syria \"do not go beyond ISIL (ISIS), al Nusra or other terrorist groups recognized by the United Nations Security Council or Russian law,\" Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Thursday.\\n\\nPushed to define \"other terrorist groups,\" Lavrov said: \"If it looks like a terrorist, if it acts like a terrorist, if it walks like a terrorist, if it fights like a terrorist, it's a terrorist, right?\"\\n\\nLavrov was addressing reporters at the U.N. in New York Thursday, on the second day of airstrikes by Russian warplanes in Syria.\\n\\nMoscow, which supports the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, has been accused of using the strikes to target anti-Assad groups including the U.S.-backed opposition group the Free Syrian Army (FSA).\\n\\nBut Lavrov said Russia does not consider the FSA a terrorist group. \"We believe that Free Syrian Army should be part of the political process,\" he said.\\n\\n\"The goal of our operation -- in response to the request of President Assad and on the basis of the decision granted by the Russian parliament to the Russian President in accordance with the Russian constitution -- the goal is terrorism and we are not supporting anyone against their own people. We fight terrorism,\" Lavrov said.\\n\\nLavrov questioned the U.S.-led coalition's legitimacy, given the mission had not received the consent of the U.N. Security Council or any \"request of one of the countries on whose territories they operate.\"\\n\\n\"You cannot avoid the impression that the legal basis of the coalition activities in Syria is really flawed,\" he said.\\n\\n\"As far as I understand, the coalition announced ISIL and other associated groups as the enemy and the coalition does the same as Russia [does]. Somehow some people try to present the coalition action as leading to a political settlement and Russia fighting the same people is being perceived or presented like defending the regime. It's absolutely unfair,\" he said.\\n\\nThe foreign minister also questioned the logic of trying to topple al-Assad to further the fight against ISIS, asking whether the removal of Saddam Hussein in Iraq and Moammar Gadhafi in Libya had made those countries better places.\\n\\nRussia's Defense Ministry issued a statement earlier Thursday saying that it had carried out new airstrikes.\\n\\n\"Russian Aerospace Forces engaged another four #ISIS facilities in #Syria this night,\" the Ministry announced on Twitter along with gun camera video showing large explosions.\\n\\nThe strikes were carried out by eight Russian SU-24 and SU-25 jets, which claimed to hit ISIS \"terrorist staff\" and an ammunition dump near Idlib and another headquarters in Hama.\\n\\nBut 24 hours into the military campaign, there were concerns it was targeting those who oppose al-Assad, including more moderate factions that are supported by the United States and others in the West.\\n\\nThe Syrian Ambassador to Russia, Riad Haddad, told CNN's Matthew Chance that Russians were fighting alongside the Syrians, to destroy not just ISIS but all of the other rebel groups in Syria.\\n\\nHaddad said all of the rebel groups, including ISIS, have a common goal: \"to spread terror.\"\\n\\nHe told CNN that the impact of the Russian airstrikes over the past few days has been more effective than all of the coalition airstrikes so far combined and that the Syrian army and the Russian army are working side by side, sharing intelligence and data and working very closely together.\\n\\nA Syrian opposition activist living north of Homs near one of the villages targeted -- Talbiseh -- told CNN that ISIS had no presence in the area.\\n\\n\"Russian warplanes were targeting civilians and innocent people only, Putin is lying about targeting Daesh militants,\" Khdaier Khushfa said via Skype. Daesh is another name for ISIS.\\n\\n\"Daesh withdrew from the northern countryside of Homs in an announcement they made a year ago after the groups refused to deal with them, including Ahrar al Sham and Revolutionaries Front,\" he said.\\n\\n\"We know that Russia is the biggest ally of the Syrian regime, and since Bashar al-Assad considers us terrorists, then there is no doubt that Putin knows these areas are under our control and not Daesh.\"\\n\\nKhushfa said the Russian strikes had killed 17 civilians in Talbiseh and 11 in Zafaraniya, despite rebel military posts and headquarters being located outside the two villages.\\n\\n\"We are used to the regime airstrikes but now the entire world is watching another country killing civilians in cold blood without taking any action,\" he said. \"We are very concerned about what will happen next -- civilians I spoke to are very scared -- it's like, after five years since the revolution started we are back to ground zero.\"\\n\\nU.S. officials have also questioned whether ISIS is active in the areas hit by the Russian strikes.\\n\\nSen. John McCain -- chairman of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee -- told CNN's Chris Cuomo that he could \"absolutely confirm\" that the initial strikes were \"against our Free Syrian Army or groups that have been armed and trained by the CIA, because we have communications with people there.\"\\n\\nMcCain called the Russian strikes \"an incredible flouting of any kind of cooperation or effort to conceal what their first -- Putin's priority is. And that is of course to prop up Bashar al-Assad.\"\\n\\nDefense Secretary Ash Carter said Wednesday that the Russian attacks, which the Kremlin said were meant to target terrorists, didn't appear to hit targets under the control of ISIS, which operates in the north and east of the country.\\n\\nBut the White House downplayed the dangers of the Russian move.\\n\\n\"I think the Russians have made clear that they're not interested in provoking a conflict,\" White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said. \"Their actions thus far indicate that that's what they believe.\"\\n\\nThe U.S. and Russian military will hold a secure video teleconference call Thursday. The U.S. will be represented by Elissa Slotkin, assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs, and Vice Adm. Frank Craig Pandolfe, director of strategic plans and policy on the Joint Staff, according to the Pentagon.\\n\\nThe Iraqi Prime Minister welcomed Russia's involvement in the fight against ISIS.\\n\\nFor that reason, al-Abadi said, Iraq appreciated anyone willing to join the fight.\\n\\n\"Our message to the Russians -- I met with Putin -- please join this fight against Da'esh,\" he said, using another name for ISIS. \"Da'esh is a dangerous terrorist organization, not only against Iraq, against Syria, against the whole region, against the whole world. It is time that we all join the same forces to fight Da'esh.\"\\n\\nIn his comments at the United Nations, Lavrov said that Russia had no plans to move its operations into Iraq.\\n\\n\"No we are not planning to expand our airstrikes to Iraq,\" he said. We are polite people -- we don't come if we are not invited.\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, the Israel Defense Forces said Thursday that senior defense officials from Israel and Russia are scheduled to meet next Tuesday in Tel Aviv to address the coordination between the two militaries in the region. Israel's deputy chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Yair Golan, along with his Russian counterpart Maj. Gen. Nikolai Bogdanovski, are to meet at the Kirya Base in Tel Aviv, the IDF said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "3024  Donald Trump a KGB Spy? 11/02/2016 In today’s video, Christopher Greene of AMTV reports Hillary Clinton campaign accusation that Donald Trump is a KGB spy is about as weak and baseless a claim as a Salem witch hunt or McCarthy era trial. It’s only because Hillary Clinton is losing that she is lobbing conspiracy theory. Citizen Quasar \\nThe way I see it, one of two things will happen: \\n1. Trump will win by a landslide but the election will be stolen via electronic voting, just like I have been predicting for over a decade, and the American People will accept the skewed election results just like they accept the TSA into their crotches. \\n2. Somebody will bust a cap in Hillary’s @$$ killing her and the election will be postponed.
