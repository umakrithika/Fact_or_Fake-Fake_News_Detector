       "      <td>Daniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is a New York writer focusing on radical Islam. \\nIn the final stretch of the election, Hillary Rodham Clinton has gone to war with the FBI. \\nThe word “unprecedented” has been thrown around so often this election that it ought to be retired. But it’s still unprecedented for the nominee of a major political party to go war with the FBI. \\nBut that’s exactly what Hillary and her people have done. Coma patients just waking up now and watching an hour of CNN from their hospital beds would assume that FBI Director James Comey is Hillary’s opponent in this election. \\nThe FBI is under attack by everyone from Obama to CNN. Hillary’s people have circulated a letter attacking Comey. There are currently more media hit pieces lambasting him than targeting Trump. It wouldn’t be too surprising if the Clintons or their allies were to start running attack ads against the FBI. \\nThe FBI’s leadership is being warned that the entire left-wing establishment will form a lynch mob if they continue going after Hillary. And the FBI’s credibility is being attacked by the media and the Democrats to preemptively head off the results of the investigation of the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton. \\nThe covert struggle between FBI agents and Obama’s DOJ people has gone explosively public. \\nThe New York Times has compared Comey to J. Edgar Hoover. Its bizarre headline, “James Comey Role Recalls Hoover’s FBI, Fairly or Not” practically admits up front that it’s spouting nonsense. The Boston Globe has published a column calling for Comey’s resignation. Not to be outdone, Time has an editorial claiming that the scandal is really an attack on all women. \\nJames Carville appeared on MSNBC to remind everyone that he was still alive and insane. He accused Comey of coordinating with House Republicans and the KGB. And you thought the “vast right wing conspiracy” was a stretch. \\nCountless media stories charge Comey with violating procedure. Do you know what’s a procedural violation? Emailing classified information stored on your bathroom server. \\nSenator Harry Reid has sent Comey a letter accusing him of violating the Hatch Act. The Hatch Act is a nice idea that has as much relevance in the age of Obama as the Tenth Amendment. But the cable news spectrum quickly filled with media hacks glancing at the Wikipedia article on the Hatch Act under the table while accusing the FBI director of one of the most awkward conspiracies against Hillary ever. \\nIf James Comey is really out to hurt Hillary, he picked one hell of a strange way to do it. \\nNot too long ago Democrats were breathing a sigh of relief when he gave Hillary Clinton a pass in a prominent public statement. If he really were out to elect Trump by keeping the email scandal going, why did he trash the investigation? Was he on the payroll of House Republicans and the KGB back then and playing it coy or was it a sudden development where Vladimir Putin and Paul Ryan talked him into taking a look at Anthony Weiner’s computer? \\nEither Comey is the most cunning FBI director that ever lived or he’s just awkwardly trying to navigate a political mess that has trapped him between a DOJ leadership whose political futures are tied to Hillary’s victory and his own bureau whose apolitical agents just want to be allowed to do their jobs. \\nThe only truly mysterious thing is why Hillary and her associates decided to go to war with a respected Federal agency. Most Americans like the FBI while Hillary Clinton enjoys a 60% unfavorable rating. \\nAnd it’s an interesting question. \\nHillary’s old strategy was to lie and deny that the FBI even had a criminal investigation underway. Instead her associates insisted that it was a security review. The FBI corrected her and she shrugged it off. But the old breezy denial approach has given way to a savage assault on the FBI. \\nPretending that nothing was wrong was a bad strategy, but it was a better one that picking a fight with the FBI while lunatic Clinton associates try to claim that the FBI is really the KGB. \\nThere are two possible explanations. \\nHillary Clinton might be arrogant enough to lash out at the FBI now that she believes that victory is near. The same kind of hubris that led her to plan her victory fireworks display could lead her to declare a war on the FBI for irritating her during the final miles of her campaign. \\nBut the other explanation is that her people panicked. \\nGoing to war with the FBI is not the behavior of a smart and focused presidential campaign. It’s an act of desperation. When a presidential candidate decides that her only option is to try and destroy the credibility of the FBI, that’s not hubris, it’s fear of what the FBI might be about to reveal about her. \\nDuring the original FBI investigation, Hillary Clinton was confident that she could ride it out. And she had good reason for believing that. But that Hillary Clinton is gone. In her place is a paranoid wreck. Within a short space of time the “positive” Clinton campaign promising to unite the country has been replaced by a desperate and flailing operation that has focused all its energy on fighting the FBI. \\nThere’s only one reason for such bizarre behavior. \\nThe Clinton campaign has decided that an FBI investigation of the latest batch of emails poses a threat to its survival. And so it’s gone all in on fighting the FBI. It’s an unprecedented step born of fear. It’s hard to know whether that fear is justified. But the existence of that fear already tells us a whole lot. \\nClinton loyalists rigged the old investigation. They knew the outcome ahead of time as well as they knew the debate questions. Now suddenly they are no longer in control. And they are afraid. \\nYou can smell the fear. \\nThe FBI has wiretaps from the investigation of the Clinton Foundation. It’s finding new emails all the time. And Clintonworld panicked. The spinmeisters of Clintonworld have claimed that the email scandal is just so much smoke without fire. All that’s here is the appearance of impropriety without any of the substance. But this isn’t how you react to smoke. It’s how you respond to a fire. \\nThe misguided assault on the FBI tells us that Hillary Clinton and her allies are afraid of a revelation bigger than the fundamental illegality of her email setup. The email setup was a preemptive cover up. The Clinton campaign has panicked badly out of the belief, right or wrong, that whatever crime the illegal setup was meant to cover up is at risk of being exposed. \\nThe Clintons have weathered countless scandals over the years. Whatever they are protecting this time around is bigger than the usual corruption, bribery, sexual assaults and abuses of power that have followed them around throughout the years. This is bigger and more damaging than any of the allegations that have already come out. And they don’t want FBI investigators anywhere near it. \\nThe campaign against Comey is pure intimidation. It’s also a warning. Any senior FBI people who value their careers are being warned to stay away. The Democrats are closing ranks around their nominee against the FBI. It’s an ugly and unprecedented scene. It may also be their last stand. \\nHillary Clinton has awkwardly wound her way through numerous scandals in just this election cycle. But she’s never shown fear or desperation before. Now that has changed. Whatever she is afraid of, it lies buried in her emails with Huma Abedin. And it can bring her down like nothing else has.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Google Pinterest Digg Linkedin Reddit Stumbleupon Print Delicious Pocket Tumblr \\nThere are two fundamental truths in this world: Paul Ryan desperately wants to be president. And Paul Ryan will never be president. Today proved it. \\nIn a particularly staggering example of political cowardice, Paul Ryan re-re-re-reversed course and announced that he was back on the Trump Train after all. This was an aboutface from where he was a few weeks ago. He had previously declared he would not be supporting or defending Trump after a tape was made public in which Trump bragged about assaulting women. Suddenly, Ryan was appearing at a pro-Trump rally and boldly declaring that he already sent in his vote to make him President of the United States. It was a surreal moment. The figurehead of the Republican Party dosed himself in gasoline, got up on a stage on a chilly afternoon in Wisconsin, and lit a match. . @SpeakerRyan says he voted for @realDonaldTrump : “Republicans, it is time to come home” https://t.co/VyTT49YvoE pic.twitter.com/wCvSCg4a5I \\n— ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) November 5, 2016 \\nThe Democratic Party couldn’t have asked for a better moment of film. Ryan’s chances of ever becoming president went down to zero in an instant. In the wreckage Trump is to leave behind in his wake, those who cravenly backed his campaign will not recover. If Ryan’s career manages to limp all the way to 2020, then the DNC will have this tape locked and loaded to be used in every ad until Election Day. \\nThe ringing endorsement of the man he clearly hates on a personal level speaks volumes about his own spinelessness. Ryan has postured himself as a “principled” conservative, and one uncomfortable with Trump’s unapologetic bigotry and sexism. However, when push came to shove, Paul Ryan – like many of his colleagues – turned into a sniveling appeaser. After all his lofty tak about conviction, his principles were a house of cards and collapsed with the slightest breeze. \\nWhat’s especially bizarre is how close Ryan came to making it through unscathed. For months the Speaker of the House refused to comment on Trump at all. His strategy seemed to be to keep his head down, pretend Trump didn’t exist, and hope that nobody remembered what happened in 2016. Now, just days away from the election, he screwed it all up. \\nIf 2016’s very ugly election has done any good it’s by exposing the utter cowardice of the Republicans who once feigned moral courage. A reality television star spit on them, hijacked their party, insulted their wives, and got every last one of them to kneel before him. What a turn of events. \\nFeatured image via Twitter</td>\n",

       "      <td>U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry said Monday that he will stop in Paris later this week, amid criticism that no top American officials attended Sunday’s unity march against terrorism.\\n\\nKerry said he expects to arrive in Paris Thursday evening, as he heads home after a week abroad. He said he will fly to France at the conclusion of a series of meetings scheduled for Thursday in Sofia, Bulgaria. He plans to meet the next day with Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and President Francois Hollande, then return to Washington.\\n\\nThe visit by Kerry, who has family and childhood ties to the country and speaks fluent French, could address some of the criticism that the United States snubbed France in its darkest hour in many years.\\n\\nThe French press on Monday was filled with questions about why neither President Obama nor Kerry attended Sunday’s march, as about 40 leaders of other nations did. Obama was said to have stayed away because his own security needs can be taxing on a country, and Kerry had prior commitments.\\n\\nAmong roughly 40 leaders who did attend was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, no stranger to intense security, who marched beside Hollande through the city streets. The highest ranking U.S. officials attending the march were Jane Hartley, the ambassador to France, and Victoria Nuland, the assistant secretary of state for European affairs. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. was in Paris for meetings with law enforcement officials but did not participate in the march.\\n\\nKerry spent Sunday at a business summit hosted by India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi. The United States is eager for India to relax stringent laws that function as barriers to foreign investment and hopes Modi’s government will act to open the huge Indian market for more American businesses.\\n\\nIn a news conference, Kerry brushed aside criticism that the United States had not sent a more senior official to Paris as “quibbling a little bit.” He noted that many staffers of the American Embassy in Paris attended the march, including the ambassador. He said he had wanted to be present at the march himself but could not because of his prior commitments in India.\\n\\n“But that is why I am going there on the way home, to make it crystal clear how passionately we feel about the events that have taken place there,” he said.\\n\\n“And I don’t think the people of France have any doubts about America’s understanding of what happened, of our personal sense of loss and our deep commitment to the people of France in this moment of trauma.”</td>\n",

According to RealClearPolitics, anywhere between 51 and 57 percent of voters had a negative opinion of the Democratic nominee. \\nAs of 11 PM Eastern, Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin remain too close to call.

       "0  Daniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is a New York writer focusing on radical Islam. \\nIn the final stretch of the election, Hillary Rodham Clinton has gone to war with the FBI. \\nThe word “unprecedented” has been thrown around so often this election that it ought to be retired. But it’s still unprecedented for the nominee of a major political party to go war with the FBI. \\nBut that’s exactly what Hillary and her people have done. Coma patients just waking up now and watching an hour of CNN from their hospital beds would assume that FBI Director James Comey is Hillary’s opponent in this election. \\nThe FBI is under attack by everyone from Obama to CNN. Hillary’s people have circulated a letter attacking Comey. There are currently more media hit pieces lambasting him than targeting Trump. It wouldn’t be too surprising if the Clintons or their allies were to start running attack ads against the FBI. \\nThe FBI’s leadership is being warned that the entire left-wing establishment will form a lynch mob if they continue going after Hillary. And the FBI’s credibility is being attacked by the media and the Democrats to preemptively head off the results of the investigation of the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton. \\nThe covert struggle between FBI agents and Obama’s DOJ people has gone explosively public. \\nThe New York Times has compared Comey to J. Edgar Hoover. Its bizarre headline, “James Comey Role Recalls Hoover’s FBI, Fairly or Not” practically admits up front that it’s spouting nonsense. The Boston Globe has published a column calling for Comey’s resignation. Not to be outdone, Time has an editorial claiming that the scandal is really an attack on all women. \\nJames Carville appeared on MSNBC to remind everyone that he was still alive and insane. He accused Comey of coordinating with House Republicans and the KGB. And you thought the “vast right wing conspiracy” was a stretch. \\nCountless media stories charge Comey with violating procedure. Do you know what’s a procedural violation? Emailing classified information stored on your bathroom server. \\nSenator Harry Reid has sent Comey a letter accusing him of violating the Hatch Act. The Hatch Act is a nice idea that has as much relevance in the age of Obama as the Tenth Amendment. But the cable news spectrum quickly filled with media hacks glancing at the Wikipedia article on the Hatch Act under the table while accusing the FBI director of one of the most awkward conspiracies against Hillary ever. \\nIf James Comey is really out to hurt Hillary, he picked one hell of a strange way to do it. \\nNot too long ago Democrats were breathing a sigh of relief when he gave Hillary Clinton a pass in a prominent public statement. If he really were out to elect Trump by keeping the email scandal going, why did he trash the investigation? Was he on the payroll of House Republicans and the KGB back then and playing it coy or was it a sudden development where Vladimir Putin and Paul Ryan talked him into taking a look at Anthony Weiner’s computer? \\nEither Comey is the most cunning FBI director that ever lived or he’s just awkwardly trying to navigate a political mess that has trapped him between a DOJ leadership whose political futures are tied to Hillary’s victory and his own bureau whose apolitical agents just want to be allowed to do their jobs. \\nThe only truly mysterious thing is why Hillary and her associates decided to go to war with a respected Federal agency. Most Americans like the FBI while Hillary Clinton enjoys a 60% unfavorable rating. \\nAnd it’s an interesting question. \\nHillary’s old strategy was to lie and deny that the FBI even had a criminal investigation underway. Instead her associates insisted that it was a security review. The FBI corrected her and she shrugged it off. But the old breezy denial approach has given way to a savage assault on the FBI. \\nPretending that nothing was wrong was a bad strategy, but it was a better one that picking a fight with the FBI while lunatic Clinton associates try to claim that the FBI is really the KGB. \\nThere are two possible explanations. \\nHillary Clinton might be arrogant enough to lash out at the FBI now that she believes that victory is near. The same kind of hubris that led her to plan her victory fireworks display could lead her to declare a war on the FBI for irritating her during the final miles of her campaign. \\nBut the other explanation is that her people panicked. \\nGoing to war with the FBI is not the behavior of a smart and focused presidential campaign. It’s an act of desperation. When a presidential candidate decides that her only option is to try and destroy the credibility of the FBI, that’s not hubris, it’s fear of what the FBI might be about to reveal about her. \\nDuring the original FBI investigation, Hillary Clinton was confident that she could ride it out. And she had good reason for believing that. But that Hillary Clinton is gone. In her place is a paranoid wreck. Within a short space of time the “positive” Clinton campaign promising to unite the country has been replaced by a desperate and flailing operation that has focused all its energy on fighting the FBI. \\nThere’s only one reason for such bizarre behavior. \\nThe Clinton campaign has decided that an FBI investigation of the latest batch of emails poses a threat to its survival. And so it’s gone all in on fighting the FBI. It’s an unprecedented step born of fear. It’s hard to know whether that fear is justified. But the existence of that fear already tells us a whole lot. \\nClinton loyalists rigged the old investigation. They knew the outcome ahead of time as well as they knew the debate questions. Now suddenly they are no longer in control. And they are afraid. \\nYou can smell the fear. \\nThe FBI has wiretaps from the investigation of the Clinton Foundation. It’s finding new emails all the time. And Clintonworld panicked. The spinmeisters of Clintonworld have claimed that the email scandal is just so much smoke without fire. All that’s here is the appearance of impropriety without any of the substance. But this isn’t how you react to smoke. It’s how you respond to a fire. \\nThe misguided assault on the FBI tells us that Hillary Clinton and her allies are afraid of a revelation bigger than the fundamental illegality of her email setup. The email setup was a preemptive cover up. The Clinton campaign has panicked badly out of the belief, right or wrong, that whatever crime the illegal setup was meant to cover up is at risk of being exposed. \\nThe Clintons have weathered countless scandals over the years. Whatever they are protecting this time around is bigger than the usual corruption, bribery, sexual assaults and abuses of power that have followed them around throughout the years. This is bigger and more damaging than any of the allegations that have already come out. And they don’t want FBI investigators anywhere near it. \\nThe campaign against Comey is pure intimidation. It’s also a warning. Any senior FBI people who value their careers are being warned to stay away. The Democrats are closing ranks around their nominee against the FBI. It’s an ugly and unprecedented scene. It may also be their last stand. \\nHillary Clinton has awkwardly wound her way through numerous scandals in just this election cycle. But she’s never shown fear or desperation before. Now that has changed. Whatever she is afraid of, it lies buried in her emails with Huma Abedin. And it can bring her down like nothing else has.     \n",

And Paul Ryan will never be president. Today proved it. \\nIn a particularly staggering example of political cowardice, Paul Ryan re-re-re-reversed course and announced that he was back on the Trump Train after all. This was an aboutface from where he was a few weeks ago. He had previously declared he would not be supporting or defending Trump after a tape was made public in which Trump bragged about assaulting women. Suddenly, Ryan was appearing at a pro-Trump rally and boldly declaring that he already sent in his vote to make him President of the United States. It was a surreal moment. The figurehead of the Republican Party dosed himself in gasoline, got up on a stage on a chilly afternoon in Wisconsin, and lit a match. . @SpeakerRyan says he voted for @realDonaldTrump : “Republicans, it is time to come home” https://t.co/VyTT49YvoE pic.twitter.com/wCvSCg4a5I \\n— ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) November 5, 2016 \\nThe Democratic Party couldn’t have asked for a better moment of film. Ryan’s chances of ever becoming president went down to zero in an instant. In the wreckage Trump is to leave behind in his wake, those who cravenly backed his campaign will not recover. If Ryan’s career manages to limp all the way to 2020, then the DNC will have this tape locked and loaded to be used in every ad until Election Day. \\nThe ringing endorsement of the man he clearly hates on a personal level speaks volumes about his own spinelessness. Ryan has postured himself as a “principled” conservative, and one uncomfortable with Trump’s unapologetic bigotry and sexism. However, when push came to shove, Paul Ryan – like many of his colleagues – turned into a sniveling appeaser. After all his lofty tak about conviction, his principles were a house of cards and collapsed with the slightest breeze. \\nWhat’s especially bizarre is how close Ryan came to making it through unscathed. For months the Speaker of the House refused to comment on Trump at all. His strategy seemed to be to keep his head down, pretend Trump didn’t exist, and hope that nobody remembered what happened in 2016. Now, just days away from the election, he screwed it all up. \\nIf 2016’s very ugly election has done any good it’s by exposing the utter cowardice of the Republicans who once feigned moral courage. A reality television star spit on them, hijacked their party, insulted their wives, and got every last one of them to kneel before him. What a turn of events. \\nFeatured image via Twitter                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "2  U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry said Monday that he will stop in Paris later this week, amid criticism that no top American officials attended Sunday’s unity march against terrorism.\\n\\nKerry said he expects to arrive in Paris Thursday evening, as he heads home after a week abroad. He said he will fly to France at the conclusion of a series of meetings scheduled for Thursday in Sofia, Bulgaria. He plans to meet the next day with Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and President Francois Hollande, then return to Washington.\\n\\nThe visit by Kerry, who has family and childhood ties to the country and speaks fluent French, could address some of the criticism that the United States snubbed France in its darkest hour in many years.\\n\\nThe French press on Monday was filled with questions about why neither President Obama nor Kerry attended Sunday’s march, as about 40 leaders of other nations did. Obama was said to have stayed away because his own security needs can be taxing on a country, and Kerry had prior commitments.\\n\\nAmong roughly 40 leaders who did attend was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, no stranger to intense security, who marched beside Hollande through the city streets. The highest ranking U.S. officials attending the march were Jane Hartley, the ambassador to France, and Victoria Nuland, the assistant secretary of state for European affairs. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. was in Paris for meetings with law enforcement officials but did not participate in the march.\\n\\nKerry spent Sunday at a business summit hosted by India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi. The United States is eager for India to relax stringent laws that function as barriers to foreign investment and hopes Modi’s government will act to open the huge Indian market for more American businesses.\\n\\nIn a news conference, Kerry brushed aside criticism that the United States had not sent a more senior official to Paris as “quibbling a little bit.” He noted that many staffers of the American Embassy in Paris attended the march, including the ambassador. He said he had wanted to be present at the march himself but could not because of his prior commitments in India.\\n\\n“But that is why I am going there on the way home, to make it crystal clear how passionately we feel about the events that have taken place there,” he said.\\n\\n“And I don’t think the people of France have any doubts about America’s understanding of what happened, of our personal sense of loss and our deep commitment to the people of France in this moment of trauma.”

       "3  — Kaydee King (@KaydeeKing) November 9, 2016 The lesson from tonight's Dem losses: Time for Democrats to start listening to the voters. Stop running the same establishment candidates. \\n— People For Bernie (@People4Bernie) November 9, 2016 If Dems didn't want a tight race they shouldn't have worked against Bernie. \\n— Walker Bragman (@WalkerBragman) November 9, 2016 \\nNew York Times columnist Paul Krugman, who was one of Hillary Clinton’s most outspoken surrogates during the contentious Democratic primary, blamed Clinton’s poor performance on Green Party candidate Jill Stein, who has so far received a negligible number of votes nationally, saying Stein was the Ralph Nader of 2016 in preventing a Clinton victory. The account @BerniesTeachers threw Krugman’s analysis back in his face. Your candidate was the issue. Take responsibility. https://t.co/KHyOuUSrFS \\n— Teachers for Bernie (@BerniesTeachers) November 9, 2016 \\nAna Navarro, a Republican who recently endorsed Hillary Clinton, summed up the preposterous nature of the 2016 presidential election in this tweet: GOP nominated the only damn candidate who could lose to Hillary Clinton. Democrats nominated the only damn candidate who could lose to Trump \\n— Ana Navarro (@ananavarro) November 9, 2016 \\nPopular left-wing Facebook page The Other 98%, which was pro-Sanders during the primary, responded to Trump’s surge by simply posting a meme of Sanders’ face with the text “All this could’ve been avoided. Thanks for nothing, DNC!” The meme has been shared almost 15,000 times in less than an hour: \\nPosted by The Other 98% on Tuesday, November 8, 2016 \\nWhile Bernie Sanders endorsed Hillary Clinton just before the Democratic National Convention in July, many of his supporters remained adamant in their refusal to support the DNC-anointed candidate, pointing to WikiLeaks’ revelations that top officials at the DNC had been working behind the scenes to tip the scales in Clinton’s favor by coordinating with media figures to circulate anti-Sanders narratives. \\nRather than attribute a potential Trump presidency to the GOP nominee’s perceived popularity among voters, the closeness of this election could be credited to Hillary Clinton’s unfavorable ratings.

       "4  It's primary day in New York and front-runners Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are leading in the polls.\\n\\nTrump is now vowing to win enough delegates to clinch the Republican nomination and prevent a contested convention. But Sens.Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Bernie Sanders, D-Vt., and Ohio Gov. John Kasich and aren't giving up just yet.\\n\\nA big win in New York could tip the scales for both the Republican and Democratic front-runners in this year's race for the White House. Clinton and Trump have each suffered losses in recent contests, shifting the momentum to their rivals.\\n\\n\"We have won eight out of the last nine caucuses and primaries! Cheer!\" Sanders recently told supporters.\\n\\nWhile wins in New York for Trump and Clinton are expected, the margins of those victories are also important.\\n\\nTrump needs to capture more than 50 percent of the vote statewide if he wants to be positioned to win all of the state's 95 GOP delegates. That would put him one step closer to avoiding a contested convention.\\n\\n\"We've got to vote and you know Cruz is way, way down in the polls,\" Trump urged supporters.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Sanders is hoping for a close race in the Empire State. A loss by 10 points means he'll need to win 80 percent of the remaining delegates to clinch the nomination.\\n\\nDespite a predicted loss in New York, Cruz hasn't lost momentum. He's hoping to sweep up more delegates this weekend while he's talking about how he can win in November.\\n\\n\"Because if I'm the nominee, we win the General Election,\" Cruz promised his supporters. \"We're beating Hillary in the key swing states, we're beating Hillary with Independents, we're beating Hillary with young people.\"\\n\\nFor now, Cruz, Kasich, and Sanders have all moved on from New York to other states. Trump and Clinton are the only two staying in their home state to watch the results come in.

       "      <td>Daniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is a New York writer focusing on radical Islam. \\nIn the final stretch of the election, Hillary Rodham Clinton has gone to war with the FBI. \\nThe word “unprecedented” has been thrown around so often this election that it ought to be retired. But it’s still unprecedented for the nominee of a major political party to go war with the FBI. \\nBut that’s exactly what Hillary and her people have done. Coma patients just waking up now and watching an hour of CNN from their hospital beds would assume that FBI Director James Comey is Hillary’s opponent in this election. \\nThe FBI is under attack by everyone from Obama to CNN. Hillary’s people have circulated a letter attacking Comey. There are currently more media hit pieces lambasting him than targeting Trump. It wouldn’t be too surprising if the Clintons or their allies were to start running attack ads against the FBI. \\nThe FBI’s leadership is being warned that the entire left-wing establishment will form a lynch mob if they continue going after Hillary. And the FBI’s credibility is being attacked by the media and the Democrats to preemptively head off the results of the investigation of the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton. \\nThe covert struggle between FBI agents and Obama’s DOJ people has gone explosively public. \\nThe New York Times has compared Comey to J. Edgar Hoover. Its bizarre headline, “James Comey Role Recalls Hoover’s FBI, Fairly or Not” practically admits up front that it’s spouting nonsense. The Boston Globe has published a column calling for Comey’s resignation. Not to be outdone, Time has an editorial claiming that the scandal is really an attack on all women. \\nJames Carville appeared on MSNBC to remind everyone that he was still alive and insane. He accused Comey of coordinating with House Republicans and the KGB. And you thought the “vast right wing conspiracy” was a stretch. \\nCountless media stories charge Comey with violating procedure. Do you know what’s a procedural violation? Emailing classified information stored on your bathroom server. \\nSenator Harry Reid has sent Comey a letter accusing him of violating the Hatch Act. The Hatch Act is a nice idea that has as much relevance in the age of Obama as the Tenth Amendment. But the cable news spectrum quickly filled with media hacks glancing at the Wikipedia article on the Hatch Act under the table while accusing the FBI director of one of the most awkward conspiracies against Hillary ever. \\nIf James Comey is really out to hurt Hillary, he picked one hell of a strange way to do it. \\nNot too long ago Democrats were breathing a sigh of relief when he gave Hillary Clinton a pass in a prominent public statement. If he really were out to elect Trump by keeping the email scandal going, why did he trash the investigation? Was he on the payroll of House Republicans and the KGB back then and playing it coy or was it a sudden development where Vladimir Putin and Paul Ryan talked him into taking a look at Anthony Weiner’s computer? \\nEither Comey is the most cunning FBI director that ever lived or he’s just awkwardly trying to navigate a political mess that has trapped him between a DOJ leadership whose political futures are tied to Hillary’s victory and his own bureau whose apolitical agents just want to be allowed to do their jobs. \\nThe only truly mysterious thing is why Hillary and her associates decided to go to war with a respected Federal agency. Most Americans like the FBI while Hillary Clinton enjoys a 60% unfavorable rating. \\nAnd it’s an interesting question. \\nHillary’s old strategy was to lie and deny that the FBI even had a criminal investigation underway. Instead her associates insisted that it was a security review. The FBI corrected her and she shrugged it off. But the old breezy denial approach has given way to a savage assault on the FBI. \\nPretending that nothing was wrong was a bad strategy, but it was a better one that picking a fight with the FBI while lunatic Clinton associates try to claim that the FBI is really the KGB. \\nThere are two possible explanations. \\nHillary Clinton might be arrogant enough to lash out at the FBI now that she believes that victory is near. The same kind of hubris that led her to plan her victory fireworks display could lead her to declare a war on the FBI for irritating her during the final miles of her campaign. \\nBut the other explanation is that her people panicked. \\nGoing to war with the FBI is not the behavior of a smart and focused presidential campaign. It’s an act of desperation. When a presidential candidate decides that her only option is to try and destroy the credibility of the FBI, that’s not hubris, it’s fear of what the FBI might be about to reveal about her. \\nDuring the original FBI investigation, Hillary Clinton was confident that she could ride it out. And she had good reason for believing that. But that Hillary Clinton is gone. In her place is a paranoid wreck. Within a short space of time the “positive” Clinton campaign promising to unite the country has been replaced by a desperate and flailing operation that has focused all its energy on fighting the FBI. \\nThere’s only one reason for such bizarre behavior. \\nThe Clinton campaign has decided that an FBI investigation of the latest batch of emails poses a threat to its survival. And so it’s gone all in on fighting the FBI. It’s an unprecedented step born of fear. It’s hard to know whether that fear is justified. But the existence of that fear already tells us a whole lot. \\nClinton loyalists rigged the old investigation. They knew the outcome ahead of time as well as they knew the debate questions. Now suddenly they are no longer in control. And they are afraid. \\nYou can smell the fear. \\nThe FBI has wiretaps from the investigation of the Clinton Foundation. It’s finding new emails all the time. And Clintonworld panicked. The spinmeisters of Clintonworld have claimed that the email scandal is just so much smoke without fire. All that’s here is the appearance of impropriety without any of the substance. But this isn’t how you react to smoke. It’s how you respond to a fire. \\nThe misguided assault on the FBI tells us that Hillary Clinton and her allies are afraid of a revelation bigger than the fundamental illegality of her email setup. The email setup was a preemptive cover up. The Clinton campaign has panicked badly out of the belief, right or wrong, that whatever crime the illegal setup was meant to cover up is at risk of being exposed. \\nThe Clintons have weathered countless scandals over the years. Whatever they are protecting this time around is bigger than the usual corruption, bribery, sexual assaults and abuses of power that have followed them around throughout the years. This is bigger and more damaging than any of the allegations that have already come out. And they don’t want FBI investigators anywhere near it. \\nThe campaign against Comey is pure intimidation. It’s also a warning. Any senior FBI people who value their careers are being warned to stay away. The Democrats are closing ranks around their nominee against the FBI. It’s an ugly and unprecedented scene. It may also be their last stand. \\nHillary Clinton has awkwardly wound her way through numerous scandals in just this election cycle. But she’s never shown fear or desperation before. Now that has changed. Whatever she is afraid of, it lies buried in her emails with Huma Abedin. And it can bring her down like nothing else has.</td>\n",

It wouldn’t be too surprising if the Clintons or their allies were to start running attack ads against the FBI. \\nThe FBI’s leadership is being warned that the entire left-wing establishment will form a lynch mob if they continue going after Hillary. And the FBI’s credibility is being attacked by the media and the Democrats to preemptively head off the results of the investigation of the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton. \\nThe covert struggle between FBI agents and Obama’s DOJ people has gone explosively public. \\nThe New York Times has compared Comey to J. Edgar Hoover. Its bizarre headline, “James Comey Role Recalls Hoover’s FBI, Fairly or Not” practically admits up front that it’s spouting nonsense. The Boston Globe has published a column calling for Comey’s resignation. Not to be outdone, Time has an editorial claiming that the scandal is really an attack on all women. \\nJames Carville appeared on MSNBC to remind everyone that he was still alive and insane. He accused Comey of coordinating with House Republicans and the KGB. And you thought the “vast right wing conspiracy” was a stretch. \\nCountless media stories charge Comey with violating procedure. Do you know what’s a procedural violation? Emailing classified information stored on your bathroom server. \\nSenator Harry Reid has sent Comey a letter accusing him of violating the Hatch Act. The Hatch Act is a nice idea that has as much relevance in the age of Obama as the Tenth Amendment. But the cable news spectrum quickly filled with media hacks glancing at the Wikipedia article on the Hatch Act under the table while accusing the FBI director of one of the most awkward conspiracies against Hillary ever. \\nIf James Comey is really out to hurt Hillary, he picked one hell of a strange way to do it. \\nNot too long ago Democrats were breathing a sigh of relief when he gave Hillary Clinton a pass in a prominent public statement. If he really were out to elect Trump by keeping the email scandal going, why did he trash the investigation? Was he on the payroll of House Republicans and the KGB back then and playing it coy or was it a sudden development where Vladimir Putin and Paul Ryan talked him into taking a look at Anthony Weiner’s computer? \\nEither Comey is the most cunning FBI director that ever lived or he’s just awkwardly trying to navigate a political mess that has trapped him between a DOJ leadership whose political futures are tied to Hillary’s victory and his own bureau whose apolitical agents just want to be allowed to do their jobs. \\nThe only truly mysterious thing is why Hillary and her associates decided to go to war with a respected Federal agency. Most Americans like the FBI while Hillary Clinton enjoys a 60% unfavorable rating. \\nAnd it’s an interesting question. \\nHillary’s old strategy was to lie and deny that the FBI even had a criminal investigation underway. Instead her associates insisted that it was a security review. The FBI corrected her and she shrugged it off. But the old breezy denial approach has given way to a savage assault on the FBI. \\nPretending that nothing was wrong was a bad strategy, but it was a better one that picking a fight with the FBI while lunatic Clinton associates try to claim that the FBI is really the KGB. \\nThere are two possible explanations. \\nHillary Clinton might be arrogant enough to lash out at the FBI now that she believes that victory is near. The same kind of hubris that led her to plan her victory fireworks display could lead her to declare a war on the FBI for irritating her during the final miles of her campaign. \\nBut the other explanation is that her people panicked. \\nGoing to war with the FBI is not the behavior of a smart and focused presidential campaign. It’s an act of desperation. When a presidential candidate decides that her only option is to try and destroy the credibility of the FBI, that’s not hubris, it’s fear of what the FBI might be about to reveal about her. \\nDuring the original FBI investigation, Hillary Clinton was confident that she could ride it out. And she had good reason for believing that. But that Hillary Clinton is gone. In her place is a paranoid wreck. Within a short space of time the “positive” Clinton campaign promising to unite the country has been replaced by a desperate and flailing operation that has focused all its energy on fighting the FBI. \\nThere’s only one reason for such bizarre behavior. \\nThe Clinton campaign has decided that an FBI investigation of the latest batch of emails poses a threat to its survival. And so it’s gone all in on fighting the FBI. It’s an unprecedented step born of fear. It’s hard to know whether that fear is justified. But the existence of that fear already tells us a whole lot. \\nClinton loyalists rigged the old investigation. They knew the outcome ahead of time as well as they knew the debate questions. Now suddenly they are no longer in control. And they are afraid. \\nYou can smell the fear. \\nThe FBI has wiretaps from the investigation of the Clinton Foundation. It’s finding new emails all the time. And Clintonworld panicked. The spinmeisters of Clintonworld have claimed that the email scandal is just so much smoke without fire. All that’s here is the appearance of impropriety without any of the substance. But this isn’t how you react to smoke. It’s how you respond to a fire. \\nThe misguided assault on the FBI tells us that Hillary Clinton and her allies are afraid of a revelation bigger than the fundamental illegality of her email setup. The email setup was a preemptive cover up. The Clinton campaign has panicked badly out of the belief, right or wrong, that whatever crime the illegal setup was meant to cover up is at risk of being exposed. \\nThe Clintons have weathered countless scandals over the years. Whatever they are protecting this time around is bigger than the usual corruption, bribery, sexual assaults and abuses of power that have followed them around throughout the years. This is bigger and more damaging than any of the allegations that have already come out. And they don’t want FBI investigators anywhere near it. \\nThe campaign against Comey is pure intimidation. It’s also a warning. Any senior FBI people who value their careers are being warned to stay away. The Democrats are closing ranks around their nominee against the FBI. It’s an ugly and unprecedented scene. It may also be their last stand. \\nHillary Clinton has awkwardly wound her way through numerous scandals in just this election cycle. But she’s never shown fear or desperation before. Now that has changed. Whatever she is afraid of, it lies buried in her emails with Huma Abedin. And it can bring her down like nothing else has.</td>\n",

       "0  Daniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is a New York writer focusing on radical Islam. \\nIn the final stretch of the election, Hillary Rodham Clinton has gone to war with the FBI. \\nThe word “unprecedented” has been thrown around so often this election that it ought to be retired. But it’s still unprecedented for the nominee of a major political party to go war with the FBI. \\nBut that’s exactly what Hillary and her people have done. Coma patients just waking up now and watching an hour of CNN from their hospital beds would assume that FBI Director James Comey is Hillary’s opponent in this election. \\nThe FBI is under attack by everyone from Obama to CNN. Hillary’s people have circulated a letter attacking Comey. There are currently more media hit pieces lambasting him than targeting Trump. It wouldn’t be too surprising if the Clintons or their allies were to start running attack ads against the FBI. \\nThe FBI’s leadership is being warned that the entire left-wing establishment will form a lynch mob if they continue going after Hillary. And the FBI’s credibility is being attacked by the media and the Democrats to preemptively head off the results of the investigation of the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton. \\nThe covert struggle between FBI agents and Obama’s DOJ people has gone explosively public. \\nThe New York Times has compared Comey to J. Edgar Hoover. Its bizarre headline, “James Comey Role Recalls Hoover’s FBI, Fairly or Not” practically admits up front that it’s spouting nonsense. The Boston Globe has published a column calling for Comey’s resignation. Not to be outdone, Time has an editorial claiming that the scandal is really an attack on all women. \\nJames Carville appeared on MSNBC to remind everyone that he was still alive and insane. He accused Comey of coordinating with House Republicans and the KGB. And you thought the “vast right wing conspiracy” was a stretch. \\nCountless media stories charge Comey with violating procedure. Do you know what’s a procedural violation? Emailing classified information stored on your bathroom server. \\nSenator Harry Reid has sent Comey a letter accusing him of violating the Hatch Act. The Hatch Act is a nice idea that has as much relevance in the age of Obama as the Tenth Amendment. But the cable news spectrum quickly filled with media hacks glancing at the Wikipedia article on the Hatch Act under the table while accusing the FBI director of one of the most awkward conspiracies against Hillary ever. \\nIf James Comey is really out to hurt Hillary, he picked one hell of a strange way to do it. \\nNot too long ago Democrats were breathing a sigh of relief when he gave Hillary Clinton a pass in a prominent public statement. If he really were out to elect Trump by keeping the email scandal going, why did he trash the investigation? Was he on the payroll of House Republicans and the KGB back then and playing it coy or was it a sudden development where Vladimir Putin and Paul Ryan talked him into taking a look at Anthony Weiner’s computer? \\nEither Comey is the most cunning FBI director that ever lived or he’s just awkwardly trying to navigate a political mess that has trapped him between a DOJ leadership whose political futures are tied to Hillary’s victory and his own bureau whose apolitical agents just want to be allowed to do their jobs. \\nThe only truly mysterious thing is why Hillary and her associates decided to go to war with a respected Federal agency. Most Americans like the FBI while Hillary Clinton enjoys a 60% unfavorable rating. \\nAnd it’s an interesting question. \\nHillary’s old strategy was to lie and deny that the FBI even had a criminal investigation underway. Instead her associates insisted that it was a security review. The FBI corrected her and she shrugged it off. But the old breezy denial approach has given way to a savage assault on the FBI. \\nPretending that nothing was wrong was a bad strategy, but it was a better one that picking a fight with the FBI while lunatic Clinton associates try to claim that the FBI is really the KGB. \\nThere are two possible explanations. \\nHillary Clinton might be arrogant enough to lash out at the FBI now that she believes that victory is near. The same kind of hubris that led her to plan her victory fireworks display could lead her to declare a war on the FBI for irritating her during the final miles of her campaign. \\nBut the other explanation is that her people panicked. \\nGoing to war with the FBI is not the behavior of a smart and focused presidential campaign. It’s an act of desperation. When a presidential candidate decides that her only option is to try and destroy the credibility of the FBI, that’s not hubris, it’s fear of what the FBI might be about to reveal about her. \\nDuring the original FBI investigation, Hillary Clinton was confident that she could ride it out. And she had good reason for believing that. But that Hillary Clinton is gone. In her place is a paranoid wreck. Within a short space of time the “positive” Clinton campaign promising to unite the country has been replaced by a desperate and flailing operation that has focused all its energy on fighting the FBI. \\nThere’s only one reason for such bizarre behavior. \\nThe Clinton campaign has decided that an FBI investigation of the latest batch of emails poses a threat to its survival. And so it’s gone all in on fighting the FBI. It’s an unprecedented step born of fear. It’s hard to know whether that fear is justified. But the existence of that fear already tells us a whole lot. \\nClinton loyalists rigged the old investigation. They knew the outcome ahead of time as well as they knew the debate questions. Now suddenly they are no longer in control. And they are afraid. \\nYou can smell the fear. \\nThe FBI has wiretaps from the investigation of the Clinton Foundation. It’s finding new emails all the time. And Clintonworld panicked. The spinmeisters of Clintonworld have claimed that the email scandal is just so much smoke without fire. All that’s here is the appearance of impropriety without any of the substance. But this isn’t how you react to smoke. It’s how you respond to a fire. \\nThe misguided assault on the FBI tells us that Hillary Clinton and her allies are afraid of a revelation bigger than the fundamental illegality of her email setup. The email setup was a preemptive cover up. The Clinton campaign has panicked badly out of the belief, right or wrong, that whatever crime the illegal setup was meant to cover up is at risk of being exposed. \\nThe Clintons have weathered countless scandals over the years. Whatever they are protecting this time around is bigger than the usual corruption, bribery, sexual assaults and abuses of power that have followed them around throughout the years. This is bigger and more damaging than any of the allegations that have already come out. And they don’t want FBI investigators anywhere near it. \\nThe campaign against Comey is pure intimidation. It’s also a warning. Any senior FBI people who value their careers are being warned to stay away. The Democrats are closing ranks around their nominee against the FBI. It’s an ugly and unprecedented scene. It may also be their last stand. \\nHillary Clinton has awkwardly wound her way through numerous scandals in just this election cycle. But she’s never shown fear or desperation before. Now that has changed. Whatever she is afraid of, it lies buried in her emails with Huma Abedin. And it can bring her down like nothing else has.     \n",

And Paul Ryan will never be president. Today proved it. \\nIn a particularly staggering example of political cowardice, Paul Ryan re-re-re-reversed course and announced that he was back on the Trump Train after all. This was an aboutface from where he was a few weeks ago. He had previously declared he would not be supporting or defending Trump after a tape was made public in which Trump bragged about assaulting women. Suddenly, Ryan was appearing at a pro-Trump rally and boldly declaring that he already sent in his vote to make him President of the United States. It was a surreal moment. The figurehead of the Republican Party dosed himself in gasoline, got up on a stage on a chilly afternoon in Wisconsin, and lit a match. . @SpeakerRyan says he voted for @realDonaldTrump : “Republicans, it is time to come home” https://t.co/VyTT49YvoE pic.twitter.com/wCvSCg4a5I \\n— ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) November 5, 2016 \\nThe Democratic Party couldn’t have asked for a better moment of film. Ryan’s chances of ever becoming president went down to zero in an instant. In the wreckage Trump is to leave behind in his wake, those who cravenly backed his campaign will not recover. If Ryan’s career manages to limp all the way to 2020, then the DNC will have this tape locked and loaded to be used in every ad until Election Day. \\nThe ringing endorsement of the man he clearly hates on a personal level speaks volumes about his own spinelessness. Ryan has postured himself as a “principled” conservative, and one uncomfortable with Trump’s unapologetic bigotry and sexism. However, when push came to shove, Paul Ryan – like many of his colleagues – turned into a sniveling appeaser. After all his lofty tak about conviction, his principles were a house of cards and collapsed with the slightest breeze. \\nWhat’s especially bizarre is how close Ryan came to making it through unscathed. For months the Speaker of the House refused to comment on Trump at all. His strategy seemed to be to keep his head down, pretend Trump didn’t exist, and hope that nobody remembered what happened in 2016. Now, just days away from the election, he screwed it all up. \\nIf 2016’s very ugly election has done any good it’s by exposing the utter cowardice of the Republicans who once feigned moral courage. A reality television star spit on them, hijacked their party, insulted their wives, and got every last one of them to kneel before him. What a turn of events. \\nFeatured image via Twitter                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "2  U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry said Monday that he will stop in Paris later this week, amid criticism that no top American officials attended Sunday’s unity march against terrorism.\\n\\nKerry said he expects to arrive in Paris Thursday evening, as he heads home after a week abroad. He said he will fly to France at the conclusion of a series of meetings scheduled for Thursday in Sofia, Bulgaria. He plans to meet the next day with Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and President Francois Hollande, then return to Washington.\\n\\nThe visit by Kerry, who has family and childhood ties to the country and speaks fluent French, could address some of the criticism that the United States snubbed France in its darkest hour in many years.\\n\\nThe French press on Monday was filled with questions about why neither President Obama nor Kerry attended Sunday’s march, as about 40 leaders of other nations did. Obama was said to have stayed away because his own security needs can be taxing on a country, and Kerry had prior commitments.\\n\\nAmong roughly 40 leaders who did attend was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, no stranger to intense security, who marched beside Hollande through the city streets. The highest ranking U.S. officials attending the march were Jane Hartley, the ambassador to France, and Victoria Nuland, the assistant secretary of state for European affairs. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. was in Paris for meetings with law enforcement officials but did not participate in the march.\\n\\nKerry spent Sunday at a business summit hosted by India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi. The United States is eager for India to relax stringent laws that function as barriers to foreign investment and hopes Modi’s government will act to open the huge Indian market for more American businesses.\\n\\nIn a news conference, Kerry brushed aside criticism that the United States had not sent a more senior official to Paris as “quibbling a little bit.” He noted that many staffers of the American Embassy in Paris attended the march, including the ambassador. He said he had wanted to be present at the march himself but could not because of his prior commitments in India.\\n\\n“But that is why I am going there on the way home, to make it crystal clear how passionately we feel about the events that have taken place there,” he said.\\n\\n“And I don’t think the people of France have any doubts about America’s understanding of what happened, of our personal sense of loss and our deep commitment to the people of France in this moment of trauma.”

       "3  — Kaydee King (@KaydeeKing) November 9, 2016 The lesson from tonight's Dem losses: Time for Democrats to start listening to the voters. Stop running the same establishment candidates. \\n— People For Bernie (@People4Bernie) November 9, 2016 If Dems didn't want a tight race they shouldn't have worked against Bernie. \\n— Walker Bragman (@WalkerBragman) November 9, 2016 \\nNew York Times columnist Paul Krugman, who was one of Hillary Clinton’s most outspoken surrogates during the contentious Democratic primary, blamed Clinton’s poor performance on Green Party candidate Jill Stein, who has so far received a negligible number of votes nationally, saying Stein was the Ralph Nader of 2016 in preventing a Clinton victory. The account @BerniesTeachers threw Krugman’s analysis back in his face. Your candidate was the issue. Take responsibility. https://t.co/KHyOuUSrFS \\n— Teachers for Bernie (@BerniesTeachers) November 9, 2016 \\nAna Navarro, a Republican who recently endorsed Hillary Clinton, summed up the preposterous nature of the 2016 presidential election in this tweet: GOP nominated the only damn candidate who could lose to Hillary Clinton. Democrats nominated the only damn candidate who could lose to Trump \\n— Ana Navarro (@ananavarro) November 9, 2016 \\nPopular left-wing Facebook page The Other 98%, which was pro-Sanders during the primary, responded to Trump’s surge by simply posting a meme of Sanders’ face with the text “All this could’ve been avoided. Thanks for nothing, DNC!” The meme has been shared almost 15,000 times in less than an hour: \\nPosted by The Other 98% on Tuesday, November 8, 2016 \\nWhile Bernie Sanders endorsed Hillary Clinton just before the Democratic National Convention in July, many of his supporters remained adamant in their refusal to support the DNC-anointed candidate, pointing to WikiLeaks’ revelations that top officials at the DNC had been working behind the scenes to tip the scales in Clinton’s favor by coordinating with media figures to circulate anti-Sanders narratives. \\nRather than attribute a potential Trump presidency to the GOP nominee’s perceived popularity among voters, the closeness of this election could be credited to Hillary Clinton’s unfavorable ratings.

       "4  It's primary day in New York and front-runners Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are leading in the polls.\\n\\nTrump is now vowing to win enough delegates to clinch the Republican nomination and prevent a contested convention. But Sens.Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Bernie Sanders, D-Vt., and Ohio Gov. John Kasich and aren't giving up just yet.\\n\\nA big win in New York could tip the scales for both the Republican and Democratic front-runners in this year's race for the White House. Clinton and Trump have each suffered losses in recent contests, shifting the momentum to their rivals.\\n\\n\"We have won eight out of the last nine caucuses and primaries! Cheer!\" Sanders recently told supporters.\\n\\nWhile wins in New York for Trump and Clinton are expected, the margins of those victories are also important.\\n\\nTrump needs to capture more than 50 percent of the vote statewide if he wants to be positioned to win all of the state's 95 GOP delegates. That would put him one step closer to avoiding a contested convention.\\n\\n\"We've got to vote and you know Cruz is way, way down in the polls,\" Trump urged supporters.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Sanders is hoping for a close race in the Empire State. A loss by 10 points means he'll need to win 80 percent of the remaining delegates to clinch the nomination.\\n\\nDespite a predicted loss in New York, Cruz hasn't lost momentum. He's hoping to sweep up more delegates this weekend while he's talking about how he can win in November.\\n\\n\"Because if I'm the nominee, we win the General Election,\" Cruz promised his supporters. \"We're beating Hillary in the key swing states, we're beating Hillary with Independents, we're beating Hillary with young people.\"\\n\\nFor now, Cruz, Kasich, and Sanders have all moved on from New York to other states. Trump and Clinton are the only two staying in their home state to watch the results come in.

       "0  You Can Smell Hillary’s Fear. Daniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is a New York writer focusing on radical Islam. \\nIn the final stretch of the election, Hillary Rodham Clinton has gone to war with the FBI. \\nThe word “unprecedented” has been thrown around so often this election that it ought to be retired. But it’s still unprecedented for the nominee of a major political party to go war with the FBI. \\nBut that’s exactly what Hillary and her people have done. Coma patients just waking up now and watching an hour of CNN from their hospital beds would assume that FBI Director James Comey is Hillary’s opponent in this election. \\nThe FBI is under attack by everyone from Obama to CNN. Hillary’s people have circulated a letter attacking Comey. There are currently more media hit pieces lambasting him than targeting Trump. It wouldn’t be too surprising if the Clintons or their allies were to start running attack ads against the FBI. \\nThe FBI’s leadership is being warned that the entire left-wing establishment will form a lynch mob if they continue going after Hillary. And the FBI’s credibility is being attacked by the media and the Democrats to preemptively head off the results of the investigation of the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton. \\nThe covert struggle between FBI agents and Obama’s DOJ people has gone explosively public. \\nThe New York Times has compared Comey to J. Edgar Hoover. Its bizarre headline, “James Comey Role Recalls Hoover’s FBI, Fairly or Not” practically admits up front that it’s spouting nonsense. The Boston Globe has published a column calling for Comey’s resignation. Not to be outdone, Time has an editorial claiming that the scandal is really an attack on all women. \\nJames Carville appeared on MSNBC to remind everyone that he was still alive and insane. He accused Comey of coordinating with House Republicans and the KGB. And you thought the “vast right wing conspiracy” was a stretch. \\nCountless media stories charge Comey with violating procedure. Do you know what’s a procedural violation? Emailing classified information stored on your bathroom server. \\nSenator Harry Reid has sent Comey a letter accusing him of violating the Hatch Act. The Hatch Act is a nice idea that has as much relevance in the age of Obama as the Tenth Amendment. But the cable news spectrum quickly filled with media hacks glancing at the Wikipedia article on the Hatch Act under the table while accusing the FBI director of one of the most awkward conspiracies against Hillary ever. \\nIf James Comey is really out to hurt Hillary, he picked one hell of a strange way to do it. \\nNot too long ago Democrats were breathing a sigh of relief when he gave Hillary Clinton a pass in a prominent public statement. If he really were out to elect Trump by keeping the email scandal going, why did he trash the investigation? Was he on the payroll of House Republicans and the KGB back then and playing it coy or was it a sudden development where Vladimir Putin and Paul Ryan talked him into taking a look at Anthony Weiner’s computer? \\nEither Comey is the most cunning FBI director that ever lived or he’s just awkwardly trying to navigate a political mess that has trapped him between a DOJ leadership whose political futures are tied to Hillary’s victory and his own bureau whose apolitical agents just want to be allowed to do their jobs. \\nThe only truly mysterious thing is why Hillary and her associates decided to go to war with a respected Federal agency. Most Americans like the FBI while Hillary Clinton enjoys a 60% unfavorable rating. \\nAnd it’s an interesting question. \\nHillary’s old strategy was to lie and deny that the FBI even had a criminal investigation underway. Instead her associates insisted that it was a security review. The FBI corrected her and she shrugged it off. But the old breezy denial approach has given way to a savage assault on the FBI. \\nPretending that nothing was wrong was a bad strategy, but it was a better one that picking a fight with the FBI while lunatic Clinton associates try to claim that the FBI is really the KGB. \\nThere are two possible explanations. \\nHillary Clinton might be arrogant enough to lash out at the FBI now that she believes that victory is near. The same kind of hubris that led her to plan her victory fireworks display could lead her to declare a war on the FBI for irritating her during the final miles of her campaign. \\nBut the other explanation is that her people panicked. \\nGoing to war with the FBI is not the behavior of a smart and focused presidential campaign. It’s an act of desperation. When a presidential candidate decides that her only option is to try and destroy the credibility of the FBI, that’s not hubris, it’s fear of what the FBI might be about to reveal about her. \\nDuring the original FBI investigation, Hillary Clinton was confident that she could ride it out. And she had good reason for believing that. But that Hillary Clinton is gone. In her place is a paranoid wreck. Within a short space of time the “positive” Clinton campaign promising to unite the country has been replaced by a desperate and flailing operation that has focused all its energy on fighting the FBI. \\nThere’s only one reason for such bizarre behavior. \\nThe Clinton campaign has decided that an FBI investigation of the latest batch of emails poses a threat to its survival. And so it’s gone all in on fighting the FBI. It’s an unprecedented step born of fear. It’s hard to know whether that fear is justified. But the existence of that fear already tells us a whole lot. \\nClinton loyalists rigged the old investigation. They knew the outcome ahead of time as well as they knew the debate questions. Now suddenly they are no longer in control. And they are afraid. \\nYou can smell the fear. \\nThe FBI has wiretaps from the investigation of the Clinton Foundation. It’s finding new emails all the time. And Clintonworld panicked. The spinmeisters of Clintonworld have claimed that the email scandal is just so much smoke without fire. All that’s here is the appearance of impropriety without any of the substance. But this isn’t how you react to smoke. It’s how you respond to a fire. \\nThe misguided assault on the FBI tells us that Hillary Clinton and her allies are afraid of a revelation bigger than the fundamental illegality of her email setup. The email setup was a preemptive cover up. The Clinton campaign has panicked badly out of the belief, right or wrong, that whatever crime the illegal setup was meant to cover up is at risk of being exposed. \\nThe Clintons have weathered countless scandals over the years. Whatever they are protecting this time around is bigger than the usual corruption, bribery, sexual assaults and abuses of power that have followed them around throughout the years. This is bigger and more damaging than any of the allegations that have already come out. And they don’t want FBI investigators anywhere near it. \\nThe campaign against Comey is pure intimidation. It’s also a warning. Any senior FBI people who value their careers are being warned to stay away. The Democrats are closing ranks around their nominee against the FBI. It’s an ugly and unprecedented scene. It may also be their last stand. \\nHillary Clinton has awkwardly wound her way through numerous scandals in just this election cycle. But she’s never shown fear or desperation before. Now that has changed. Whatever she is afraid of, it lies buried in her emails with Huma Abedin. And it can bring her down like nothing else has.    \n",
       "1  Watch The Exact Moment Paul Ryan Committed Political Suicide At A Trump Rally (VIDEO). Google Pinterest Digg Linkedin Reddit Stumbleupon Print Delicious Pocket Tumblr \\nThere are two fundamental truths in this world: Paul Ryan desperately wants to be president. And Paul Ryan will never be president. Today proved it. \\nIn a particularly staggering example of political cowardice, Paul Ryan re-re-re-reversed course and announced that he was back on the Trump Train after all. This was an aboutface from where he was a few weeks ago. He had previously declared he would not be supporting or defending Trump after a tape was made public in which Trump bragged about assaulting women. Suddenly, Ryan was appearing at a pro-Trump rally and boldly declaring that he already sent in his vote to make him President of the United States. It was a surreal moment. The figurehead of the Republican Party dosed himself in gasoline, got up on a stage on a chilly afternoon in Wisconsin, and lit a match. . @SpeakerRyan says he voted for @realDonaldTrump : “Republicans, it is time to come home” https://t.co/VyTT49YvoE pic.twitter.com/wCvSCg4a5I \\n— ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) November 5, 2016 \\nThe Democratic Party couldn’t have asked for a better moment of film. Ryan’s chances of ever becoming president went down to zero in an instant. In the wreckage Trump is to leave behind in his wake, those who cravenly backed his campaign will not recover. If Ryan’s career manages to limp all the way to 2020, then the DNC will have this tape locked and loaded to be used in every ad until Election Day. \\nThe ringing endorsement of the man he clearly hates on a personal level speaks volumes about his own spinelessness. Ryan has postured himself as a “principled” conservative, and one uncomfortable with Trump’s unapologetic bigotry and sexism. However, when push came to shove, Paul Ryan – like many of his colleagues – turned into a sniveling appeaser. After all his lofty tak about conviction, his principles were a house of cards and collapsed with the slightest breeze. \\nWhat’s especially bizarre is how close Ryan came to making it through unscathed. For months the Speaker of the House refused to comment on Trump at all. His strategy seemed to be to keep his head down, pretend Trump didn’t exist, and hope that nobody remembered what happened in 2016. Now, just days away from the election, he screwed it all up. \\nIf 2016’s very ugly election has done any good it’s by exposing the utter cowardice of the Republicans who once feigned moral courage. A reality television star spit on them, hijacked their party, insulted their wives, and got every last one of them to kneel before him. What a turn of events. \\nFeatured image via Twitter                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "2  Kerry to go to Paris in gesture of sympathy. U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry said Monday that he will stop in Paris later this week, amid criticism that no top American officials attended Sunday’s unity march against terrorism.\\n\\nKerry said he expects to arrive in Paris Thursday evening, as he heads home after a week abroad. He said he will fly to France at the conclusion of a series of meetings scheduled for Thursday in Sofia, Bulgaria. He plans to meet the next day with Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and President Francois Hollande, then return to Washington.\\n\\nThe visit by Kerry, who has family and childhood ties to the country and speaks fluent French, could address some of the criticism that the United States snubbed France in its darkest hour in many years.\\n\\nThe French press on Monday was filled with questions about why neither President Obama nor Kerry attended Sunday’s march, as about 40 leaders of other nations did. Obama was said to have stayed away because his own security needs can be taxing on a country, and Kerry had prior commitments.\\n\\nAmong roughly 40 leaders who did attend was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, no stranger to intense security, who marched beside Hollande through the city streets. The highest ranking U.S. officials attending the march were Jane Hartley, the ambassador to France, and Victoria Nuland, the assistant secretary of state for European affairs. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. was in Paris for meetings with law enforcement officials but did not participate in the march.\\n\\nKerry spent Sunday at a business summit hosted by India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi. The United States is eager for India to relax stringent laws that function as barriers to foreign investment and hopes Modi’s government will act to open the huge Indian market for more American businesses.\\n\\nIn a news conference, Kerry brushed aside criticism that the United States had not sent a more senior official to Paris as “quibbling a little bit.” He noted that many staffers of the American Embassy in Paris attended the march, including the ambassador. He said he had wanted to be present at the march himself but could not because of his prior commitments in India.\\n\\n“But that is why I am going there on the way home, to make it crystal clear how passionately we feel about the events that have taken place there,” he said.\\n\\n“And I don’t think the people of France have any doubts about America’s understanding of what happened, of our personal sense of loss and our deep commitment to the people of France in this moment of trauma.”

       "3  Bernie supporters on Twitter erupt in anger against the DNC: 'We tried to warn you!'. — Kaydee King (@KaydeeKing) November 9, 2016 The lesson from tonight's Dem losses: Time for Democrats to start listening to the voters. Stop running the same establishment candidates. \\n— People For Bernie (@People4Bernie) November 9, 2016 If Dems didn't want a tight race they shouldn't have worked against Bernie. \\n— Walker Bragman (@WalkerBragman) November 9, 2016 \\nNew York Times columnist Paul Krugman, who was one of Hillary Clinton’s most outspoken surrogates during the contentious Democratic primary, blamed Clinton’s poor performance on Green Party candidate Jill Stein, who has so far received a negligible number of votes nationally, saying Stein was the Ralph Nader of 2016 in preventing a Clinton victory. The account @BerniesTeachers threw Krugman’s analysis back in his face. Your candidate was the issue. Take responsibility. https://t.co/KHyOuUSrFS \\n— Teachers for Bernie (@BerniesTeachers) November 9, 2016 \\nAna Navarro, a Republican who recently endorsed Hillary Clinton, summed up the preposterous nature of the 2016 presidential election in this tweet: GOP nominated the only damn candidate who could lose to Hillary Clinton. Democrats nominated the only damn candidate who could lose to Trump \\n— Ana Navarro (@ananavarro) November 9, 2016 \\nPopular left-wing Facebook page The Other 98%, which was pro-Sanders during the primary, responded to Trump’s surge by simply posting a meme of Sanders’ face with the text “All this could’ve been avoided. Thanks for nothing, DNC!” The meme has been shared almost 15,000 times in less than an hour: \\nPosted by The Other 98% on Tuesday, November 8, 2016 \\nWhile Bernie Sanders endorsed Hillary Clinton just before the Democratic National Convention in July, many of his supporters remained adamant in their refusal to support the DNC-anointed candidate, pointing to WikiLeaks’ revelations that top officials at the DNC had been working behind the scenes to tip the scales in Clinton’s favor by coordinating with media figures to circulate anti-Sanders narratives. \\nRather than attribute a potential Trump presidency to the GOP nominee’s perceived popularity among voters, the closeness of this election could be credited to Hillary Clinton’s unfavorable ratings.

       "4  The Battle of New York: Why This Primary Matters. It's primary day in New York and front-runners Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are leading in the polls.\\n\\nTrump is now vowing to win enough delegates to clinch the Republican nomination and prevent a contested convention. But Sens.Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Bernie Sanders, D-Vt., and Ohio Gov. John Kasich and aren't giving up just yet.\\n\\nA big win in New York could tip the scales for both the Republican and Democratic front-runners in this year's race for the White House. Clinton and Trump have each suffered losses in recent contests, shifting the momentum to their rivals.\\n\\n\"We have won eight out of the last nine caucuses and primaries! Cheer!\" Sanders recently told supporters.\\n\\nWhile wins in New York for Trump and Clinton are expected, the margins of those victories are also important.\\n\\nTrump needs to capture more than 50 percent of the vote statewide if he wants to be positioned to win all of the state's 95 GOP delegates. That would put him one step closer to avoiding a contested convention.\\n\\n\"We've got to vote and you know Cruz is way, way down in the polls,\" Trump urged supporters.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Sanders is hoping for a close race in the Empire State. A loss by 10 points means he'll need to win 80 percent of the remaining delegates to clinch the nomination.\\n\\nDespite a predicted loss in New York, Cruz hasn't lost momentum. He's hoping to sweep up more delegates this weekend while he's talking about how he can win in November.\\n\\n\"Because if I'm the nominee, we win the General Election,\" Cruz promised his supporters. \"We're beating Hillary in the key swing states, we're beating Hillary with Independents, we're beating Hillary with young people.\"\\n\\nFor now, Cruz, Kasich, and Sanders have all moved on from New York to other states. Trump and Clinton are the only two staying in their home state to watch the results come in.

       "      <td>CAN IT GET MORE CORRUPT? Bill That Bans Naming Officers Involved in Shootings Goes to Pennsylvania Governor. Editor’s Note : Disgusting. This country just gets more and more corrupt by the day… it’s insane. Pretty soon it will collapse of its own weight under so much disgusting corruption.\\n\\nThe Pennsylvania legislature has passed a law prohibiting the release of officers’ names for up to 30 days after a police-related death has occurred. It was backed by Philadelphia police unions and will become law if signed by Democratic Governor Tom Wolf.\\nThe measure passed Thursday after the Republican-controlled legislature voted along party lines. If the bill becomes law, it will prevent public officials from releasing the names of officers involved in shootings which cause death or “ serious bodily injury ” for up to 30 days after the incident, or until the conclusion of an official investigation.\\nThe bill, HB 1538, was sponsored by state Rep. Martina White (R-Philadelphia) and is a direct contradiction of the Philadelphia Police Department’s policy of releasing names within 72 hours of a shooting.\\nThe 72-hour rule was created by the Department of Justice and put into place by former police commissioner Charles H. Ramsey in 2014, after it was recommended. Speaking in support of the rule at the time, Ramsey said : “ I don’t think you can reasonably expect to shoot people and remain anonymous. ”\\nHowever, the influential Philadelphia Police Union has defended HB 1538.\\n“ We’re just asking to put a lid on the boiling pot until things calm down, especially if it’s an investigation that could lead to protests in the community, ” John McNesby, president of the 14,500-strong union, told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.\\nWhite claims the bill is needed, due to the dangers faced by police officers\\n“ I was watching the television and just saw how officers are being gunned down and other officers in different states had been subjected to harassment and the very things that they are trying to protect citizens like ourselves from experiencing, and to me the 72-hour rule is really just an arbitrary number, ” White told the Post-Gazette.\\nHowever, neither McNesby nor White could identify any instances of officers or their families being harmed due to being publicly identified.\\nMcNesby told the Post-Gazette that he was unaware of any direct threats that had taken place, but said “ that’s what we’re looking to stop before it becomes a reality. ”\\nThe American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania has criticized the bill, calling it “ a policy that will heighten tensions between the police and the communities they serve” and accusing it of being “completely tone deaf to the needs of communities that are impacted by police brutality. ”\\nRep. Margo Davidson (D-Delaware County) has also spoken out against the bill, saying it undermines “ the bridges that have been built between law enforcement and communities of color. ” She added that “ this legislation will do nothing but breed suspicion. ”\\nDavidson, along with many other Philadelphia Democrats, opposed the bill in the 151-32 vote.\\nGovernor Wolf has yet to comment on whether or not he will sign the bill, which passed the Senate and House with a veto-proof majority. If Wolf still decides to veto, an override of that veto would only be able to take place after the next election.\\n\\nRead Also: War on Cops Debunked: More Cops Died by Accident Than Violence in 2015 \\nDelivered by The Daily Sheeple \\nWe encourage you to share and republish our reports, analyses, breaking news and videos ( Click for details ). \\nContributed by RT.com of RT.com .</td>\n",

       "      <td>Magnificent Jellyfish Gardens Purify The Water While Growing Food. These Jellyfish Lodges are capable of purifying waterways, collecting discarded trash, and even growing nutritious food! By Amanda Froelich \\nIntriguing eco-friendly innovations are unveiled all the time, but the floating Jellyfish Lodge is probably unlike anything you’ve ever seen before. In addition to being aesthetically appealing, the lodges can purify the land, air, and water and grow nourishing food.\\nDesigner Janine Hung relays that the structures combine trash-collecting tentacles, aquaponic gardens, and a filtration system that all work to benefit the environment.\\n\\nThe solar-powered lodges utilize aquaponic technology to grow fruits and vegetables while cleaning the air with an electrostatic system. Each structure features and interior garden that thrives by filtering polluted water. Additionally, long tentacle arms which appear similar to a jellyfish’s collect drifting trash without harming wildlife.\\nUnfortunately, it’s not likely this design will be realized, as it only received an Honorable Mention award in this year’s Biodesign Competition , reports Inhabitat . However, it’s so neat we figured the concept needed to be shared.\\n\\n\\nAn intriguing feature of the lodge is that it can test water for toxicity and start the process of treating water through a unique microbial digestion chamber. Once the water is purified, it can be returned to the surrounding environment.\\nIf these structures are eventually created, they’d ideally be maintained by nearby residents who could utilize the foods in their holistic kitchens .\\n\\nHung hopes that the Jellyfish Lodges are eventually constructed to serve as a solution to problems plaguing the world’s waterways, including acidification and pollution .\\nImage Credit: Janine Hung \\nSource: True Activist \\n</td>\n",

end activists in the united states are considering the prospects for war and peace under the next administration\\nand with hillary clinton leading comfortably in most polls the democratic nominees militaristic record as well as her promises to expand the use of force are sparking concern\\nclinton is one of the biggest warmongers the country has joe lombardo cocoordinator of the united national antiwar coalition told mintpress news\\nshe pushed for the bombing of libya and the regime change in that country she has supported a nofly zone in syria which can put the us in direct conflict with russia\\non the campaign trail clinton has repeatedly advocated a nofly zone in syria an aggressive move necessarily accompanied by a widespread bombing campaign similar to those in iraq and libya which were followed by expanded interventions to impose regime change\\nsenior us military pilots have warned that the proposal could plunge the united states into direct conflict with russia whose air force is currently deployed over syria\\nin september joseph dunford chairman of the joint chiefs of staff told the senate that the prospect requires us to go to war against syria and russia\\nkill a lot of syrians it is critical that we not be confused about what clintons promise of a nofly zone will mean meredith aby of the minneapolisbased antiwar committee told mintpress\\nit is an escalation of us involvement in the syrian civil war and it will mean an increase in casualties\\nin  clinton herself admitted in a paid speech to goldman sachs obtained and released by wikileaks in september that her proposal would kill a lot of syrians\\nto have a nofly zone you have to take out all of the air defense many of which are located in populated areas she said\\nbeyond syria clinton has also threatened to attack and totally obliterate iran and she has repeatedly promised to take the united states ties with israel to the next level\\nin august after accusing russia and china of hacking us computer systems she warned we will be ready with serious political economic and military responses\\na voice for war since  us secretary of state hillary clinton left israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu talk in jerusalem israel monday july  \\nthese statements along with clintons long unbroken record of supporting military interventions have antiwar activists eying the future warily\\nmany in the antiwar movement understand the dangers of a clinton presidency aby said\\nfrom her resume it is fairly obvious she will be a hawk more so than president obama and president clinton she has been a voice for war since  when she voted for war in iraq\\nbeyond clintons explicit threats of wars her administration may also seek to expand the use of soft power ranging from diplomatic assistance and military aid to subversion and coups in pursuit of its foreign policy goals\\nshe has called for boosting us support for israeli missile defense systems and supports helping israel with technology to fight in gaza aby said adding\\non the campaign trail she has denounced the boycott divestment and sanctions bds movement as a threat to israel and while she hasnt campaigned on it she is no friend of latin america her own emails show the role she played in helping provide support for the coup in honduras\\nlombardo also noted that regions further removed from the headlines than flashpoints like syria could face similar threats from a hillary clinton administration\\nthe philippines is heating up and clinton has a history in latin america where there are many places that the us would like to see regime change he said\\na very unpopular president from day one in the waning months of the campaign both clinton and her republican rival donald trump have emerged as historically unpopular candidates more so than others in the era of scientific polling\\nindeed while trumps aggression has kept his popularity below clintons she recently surpassed the bellicose billionaire as the leastliked candidate in history\\na poll released by abc news and the washington post on tuesday showed clintons unpopularity had reached a recordbreaking  percent while

       "      <td>Anti-War Movement Anticipates More War Under A Clinton Presidency. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton speaks during a news conference at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, December 5, 2012.\\nNEW YORK — As the bizarre 2016 presidential election nears its end, activists in the United States are considering the prospects for war and peace under the next administration.\\nAnd with Hillary Clinton leading comfortably in most polls, the Democratic nominee’s militaristic record, as well as her promises to expand the use of force, are sparking concern.\\n“Clinton is one of the biggest war-mongers the country has,” Joe Lombardo, co-coordinator of the United National Antiwar Coalition , told MintPress News.\\n“She pushed for the bombing of Libya and the regime change in that country. She has supported a no-fly zone in Syria, which can put the U.S. in direct conflict with Russia.”\\nOn the campaign trail, Clinton has repeatedly advocated a “no-fly zone” in Syria, an aggressive move necessarily accompanied by a widespread bombing campaign, similar to those in Iraq and Libya, which were followed by expanded interventions to impose regime change.\\nSenior U.S. military pilots have warned that the proposal could plunge the United States into direct conflict with Russia, whose air force is currently deployed over Syria.\\nIn September, Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the Senate that the prospect “requires us to go to war against Syria and Russia.”\\n‘Kill a lot of Syrians’ “It is critical that we not be confused about what Clinton’s promise of a no-fly zone will mean,” Meredith Aby of the Minneapolis-based Anti-War Committee told MintPress.\\n“It is an escalation of U.S. involvement in the Syrian civil war and it will mean an increase in casualties.”\\nIn 2013, Clinton herself admitted in a paid speech to Goldman Sachs, obtained and released by WikiLeaks in September, that her proposal would “kill a lot of Syrians.”\\n“To have a no-fly zone you have to take out all of the air defense, many of which are located in populated areas,” she said.\\nBeyond Syria, Clinton has also threatened to attack and “totally obliterate” Iran , and she has repeatedly promised to take the United States’ ties with Israel “to the next level.”\\nIn August, after accusing Russia and China of hacking U.S. computer systems, she warned : “We will be ready with serious political, economic and military responses.”\\n‘A voice for war since 2002’ US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, left, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu talk in Jerusalem, Israel, Monday, July 16, 2012.\\nThese statements, along with Clinton’s long, unbroken record of supporting military interventions, have anti-war activists eying the future warily.\\n“Many in the anti-war movement understand the dangers of a Clinton presidency,” Aby said.\\n“From her resume it is fairly obvious she will be a hawk, more so than President Obama and President Clinton. She has been a voice for war since 2002 when she voted for war in Iraq.”\\nBeyond Clinton’s explicit threats of wars, her administration may also seek to expand the use of “soft power,” ranging from diplomatic assistance and military aid to subversion and coups, in pursuit of its foreign policy goals.\\n“She has called for boosting U.S. support for Israeli missile defense systems and supports helping Israel with technology to fight in Gaza,” Aby said, adding:\\n“On the campaign trail, she has denounced the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement as a threat to Israel. And while she hasn’t campaigned on it, she is no friend of Latin America. Her own emails show the role she played in helping provide support for the coup in Honduras.”\\nLombardo also noted that regions further removed from the headlines than flashpoints like Syria could face similar threats from a Hillary Clinton administration.\\n“The Philippines is heating up and Clinton has a history in Latin America, where there are many places that the U.S. would like to see regime change,” he said.\\n‘A very unpopular president from day one’ In the waning months of the campaign, both Clinton and her Republican rival, Donald Trump, have emerged as historically unpopular candidates , more so than others in the era of scientific polling.\\nIndeed, while Trump’s aggression has kept his popularity below Clinton’s, she recently surpassed the bellicose billionaire as the least-liked candidate in history.\\nA poll released by ABC News and the Washington Post on Tuesday showed Clinton’s unpopularity had reached a record-breaking 60 percent, while Trump’s stood at 58 percent.\\nDespite her jingoism and promises to expand U.S. military efforts far beyond those of Barack Obama, organizers hope this public disdain may give them room to maneuver.\\n“Although Clinton will win the presidency, she will be a very unpopular president from day one, which will give us the political space to organize opposition to her foreign policy,” Aby said.\\nLombardo agreed. “Clinton is very unpopular, and while the election of Obama put a damper on the anti-war movement, I believe we will see that turn around under Clinton.”\\nHe also noted the growth of domestic social movements, like Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter, that could herald a resurgence in mobilization.\\n“There is a downturn in the economy, distrust of the government and the system as a whole,” Lombardo said. “The connections with the wars abroad and the wars at home is clear to more and more people. I think a movement against increased war can be explosive and powerful during a Clinton administration.”\\nBut he added that there was much work to be done. “Although anti-war sentiment in the U.S. is high, the anti-war movement in weak compared to where it was in the past.”\\n‘No optimism, only apprehension’ A woman with the words “hands off” painted on her face takes part in a protest organized by the Stop the War coalition calling for no military attack on Syria from the U.S., Britain or France, across the road from the entrance of Downing Street in London, Wednesday, Aug. 28, 2013.\\nAs the clock ticks down to the election, numerous organizations have launched new efforts they hope will preempt the war drive expected to start soon after Jan. 20.\\nAlong with other groups and individual supporters, the United National Antiwar Coalition launched a “Hands Off Syria Coalition” and accompanying statement against further U.S. intervention in the war-torn country.\\nThe effort “is getting a tremendous response,” Lombardo said.\\nOther organizations, including the ANSWER Coalition and International Action Center , have called for protests against the inauguration in Washington.\\n“There’s no optimism, only apprehension,” International Action Center co-director Sara Flounders told MintPress. “People know in their bones that a larger war is coming. From the first day of a new administration, we need to send an angry warning.”\\nBut with the United States fatigued from a grueling election season that has left few residents with positive impressions of either candidate, widespread distrust of the political system may deny the new president the mandate he or she would need to embark on new military adventures.\\n“I think people are less naive now then they were eight years ago,” Aby said. “People understand that foreign policy is not an issue that truly separates the two major party candidates.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>How To Reduce Stress. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter The root cause of stress is fear, as all fear is the threat of losing our attachments. If we’re attached to a desired outcome, anything that threatens it will be something we fear. The fear of losing control underpins stress, for example, and creates frustration over what can’t be controlled. As desirable as it is to be in a position of control, our attachment to it ultimately creates a fear that can manifest as stress, worry, anxiety, and panic. advertisement - learn more Fear brings disorder into our experience when it is within us, and it’s an energy that suppresses consciousness. Activation energy is the force required to get you from doing something when you’re on autopilot (such as habits, routines, procedural awareness, or relaxing) to doing something new. It is a manifestation of willpower. When we are in a state of fear (stress), our activation energy is diverted toward doing things to ourselves that are primarily against our will. Running late for work and caught in a traffic jam? You can either become frustrated and upset because you fear arriving to work late (which brings you no closer to your goal of getting there on time), or you can accept the present moment and use it as a learning lesson to leave earlier next time. You can also choose to enjoy the unexpected free time in the morning and listen to a podcast or some music. There are many choices you can make in that space of time that can affect or degrade even the most minute increments of your personal development. Stress causes you to divert attention and willpower away from your initial goal, bringing you no closer to it than when you began. In a state of stress and fear, your willpower gets diverted toward the threat, not the goal, and this is against your own best interest. Time is currency, so pay attention to what you spend your time on. advertisement - learn more Now of course there are valid situations where your willpower MUST be diverted toward dealing with the threat or there might not be any willpower left for you to use in the future! There are two types of fear: survival based fear and ego based fear. Ego fear includes fear of rejection, failure, humiliation, loss, uncertainty, lack of control, etc. These fears are not real, but may feel so to you. Ask yourself, what’s the worst that could happen? Is it death, the loss of freedom, a loved one suffering? If it’s none of those then you’re too attached to an outcome that is not essential to your wholeness. When we’re mindful of our awareness, extraordinary things await us on the opposite side of fear. Believe. Believe in what? Yourself? A higher power? Both? Believe in the truth of your situation by first accepting everything that is happening. You can’t move forward in a state of denial because denial is resistance. Then think about what you’re afraid of (an outcome, for example) and why it is making you feel afraid. What will you lose that is causing your anxiety? What is this thing that you’re holding onto that is vital to your security and wholeness? Fear should be an alarm, not a program. An alarm alerts you of danger, while a program controls and runs the show. When ALERTED by fear we can use the logic of our conscious mind to analyze if we are in any real danger, rather than allowing the subconscious mind and its primal instincts to impulsively control us. Even if we don’t lash out during times of stress and frustration, we may remain divided and chaotic internally, throwing emotional temper tantrums no one else sees. Do your job to parent yourself and take control of the inner child embedded in your subconscious mind (we all have one).

You would be oblivious to yourself without fear, which makes it one of the greatest tools of awareness. You shouldn’t feel ashamed of it; regardless of how tough you are, every human being feels fear. People who suppress fear are glorified. Rather than suppress it, feel it and come to terms with it. This way you won’t feel the need to suppress it because you have already gotten to its source: truth. And the truth will always wipe out fear. By suppressing fear you’re ignoring your personal lesson. We often ignore what our emotional guidance system is trying to tell us because we don’t think fear is valid.

Sometimes fear is legitimate and sometimes it is not, but we must always pay attention to it so we can get to the Truth of why it’s there. Fear of the unknown is also common. Since we know nothing about the unkown, what we actually fear is whatever we ourselves project into it. We think we know what potential negative thing the unknown might hold for us and we are running from the projection of that potential pain. We fear what we project into the unknown based on our previous experiences (mostly from childhood) of uncertainty and discomfort. The reptile brain seeks comfort, so anything that is uncomfortable alerts our primal survival drives. These red flags create anxious moments to our pleasure-seeking and pain-avoiding ego. When faced with the unknown, the mind goes to work projecting its already acquired fears into the unknown so that it can predict what lies there. It’s those projections that we fear. It’s not the unknown of that experience that it fears, it’s what it thinks it knows that experience will create. We need to be brave enough to face and admit to what we actually fear. This may sound counterintuitive, but everything we do, regardless of how stupid or damaging it is for ourselves, has a positive intention at its core. Anxiety responses aim to help us — usually to get us out of a situation, to protect us. Every behaviour that we generate, even if it’s detrimental to our long-term growth and happiness, has a positive intention behind it, and recognizing this will allow you to change the behaviour. Your subconscious mind wants to protect you but it doesn’t think long-term with respect to your growth and happiness; it reacts in the present moment, and wants to deal with the perceived danger NOW. The subconscious is always thinking about what’s happening now, and how to fix it now. It thinks, “How do I get out of it? How do I survive it?” While your subconscious mind is intuitive, smart, and integral to the mind-body system, it is also deeply irrational and has the cognitive capacity of a 10-year-old child. Ask yourself, would you let a 10-year-old run your life? We need to educate and guide the subconscious mind using its own language and worldview. The subconscious mind’s job is to keep you happy, healthy, and safe, so when you give it a way to understand that what it’s doing is hurting you, it will stop the behaviour. If the subconscious mind has to choose between safety and happiness, it will always chose safety. Self-preservation is its primary objective, to protect you and keep you alive so you can move your genes forward. Do not justify your fear. While something could have happened to you that created the fear, such as a traumatic event, you must still move beyond it. It may be difficult, but when you justify your fear, in whatever terms, you remain a prisoner to it. You give yourself a reason to hold onto the fear because you’re telling yourself that this fear is coming from the outside instead of its true source, the inside. Once you become aware of something, you have the choice and power to change it. Your belief systems determine your ability to overcome your fears. If you tell yourself, “I can’t overcome this fear,” you ensure this remains true. As long as you believe it, it will be True in your reality. The perception we have of ourselves is greater than the perception other people have of us. Your perceptions will determine how you will react, which in turn determines how long the fear will last in your life. Facing your greatest fears will be your greatest liberation. Your fears are your unresolved issues; once you get to the Truth of why they exist, you can resolve those issues and stop feeding the fears. We must let go of and reexamine what we think is good and bad because our perspective shapes our fears. \\nThe Sacred Science follows eight people from around the world, with varying physical and psychological illnesses, as they embark on a one-month healing journey into the heart of the Amazon jungle. \\nYou can watch this documentary film FREE for 10 days by clicking here. \\n\"If “Survivor” was actually real and had stakes worth caring about, it would be what happens here, and “The Sacred Science” hopefully is merely one in a long line of exciting endeavors from this group.\" - Billy Okeefe, McClatchy Tribune</td>\n",

       "5065  editors note disgusting this country just gets more and more corrupt by the day its insane pretty soon it will collapse of its own weight under so much disgusting corruption\\n\\nthe pennsylvania legislature has passed a law prohibiting the release of officers names for up to  days after a policerelated death has occurred it was backed by philadelphia police unions and will become law if signed by democratic governor tom wolf\\nthe measure passed thursday after the republicancontrolled legislature voted along party lines if the bill becomes law it will prevent public officials from releasing the names of officers involved in shootings which cause death or serious bodily injury for up to  days after the incident or until the conclusion of an official investigation\\nthe bill hb  was sponsored by state rep martina white rphiladelphia and is a direct contradiction of the philadelphia police departments policy of releasing names within  hours of a shooting\\nthe hour rule was created by the department of justice and put into place by former police commissioner charles h ramsey in  after it was recommended speaking in support of the rule at the time ramsey said  i dont think you can reasonably expect to shoot people and remain anonymous \\nhowever the influential philadelphia police union has defended hb \\n were just asking to put a lid on the boiling pot until things calm down especially if its an investigation that could lead to protests in the community john mcnesby president of the strong union told the pittsburgh postgazette\\nwhite claims the bill is needed due to the dangers faced by police officers\\n i was watching the television and just saw how officers are being gunned down and other officers in different states had been subjected to harassment and the very things that they are trying to protect citizens like ourselves from experiencing and to me the hour rule is really just an arbitrary number white told the postgazette\\nhowever neither mcnesby nor white could identify any instances of officers or their families being harmed due to being publicly identified\\nmcnesby told the postgazette that he was unaware of any direct threats that had taken place but said thats what were looking to stop before it becomes a reality \\nthe american civil liberties union of pennsylvania has criticized the bill calling it a policy that will heighten tensions between the police and the communities they serve and accusing it of being completely tone deaf to the needs of communities that are impacted by police brutality \\nrep margo davidson ddelaware county has also spoken out against the bill saying it undermines the bridges that have been built between law enforcement and communities of color she added that this legislation will do nothing but breed suspicion \\ndavidson along with many other philadelphia democrats opposed the bill in the  vote\\ngovernor wolf has yet to comment on whether or not he will sign the bill which passed the senate and house with a vetoproof majority if wolf still decides to veto an override of that veto would only be able to take place after the next election\\n\\nread also war on cops

       "1320  these jellyfish lodges are capable of purifying waterways collecting discarded trash and even growing nutritious food by amanda froelich \\nintriguing ecofriendly innovations are unveiled all the time but the floating jellyfish lodge is probably unlike anything youve ever seen before in addition to being aesthetically appealing the lodges can purify the land air and water and grow nourishing food\\ndesigner janine hung relays that the structures combine trashcollecting tentacles aquaponic gardens and a filtration system that all work to benefit the environment\\n\\nthe solarpowered lodges utilize aquaponic technology to grow fruits and vegetables while cleaning the air with an electrostatic system each structure features and interior garden that thrives by filtering polluted water additionally long tentacle arms which appear similar to a jellyfishs collect drifting trash without harming wildlife\\nunfortunately its not likely this design will be realized as it only received an honorable mention award in this years biodesign competition reports inhabitat however its so neat we figured the concept needed to be shared\\n\\n\\nan intriguing feature of the lodge is that it can test water for toxicity and start the process of treating water through a unique microbial digestion chamber once the water is purified it can be returned to the surrounding environment\\nif these structures are eventually created theyd ideally be maintained by nearby residents who could utilize the foods in their holistic kitchens \\n\\nhung hopes that the jellyfish lodges are eventually constructed to serve as a solution to problems plaguing the worlds waterways including acidification and pollution \\nimage credit janine hung \\nsource true activist \\n

       "610   share on facebook share on twitter the root cause of stress is fear as all fear is the threat of losing our attachments if were attached to a desired outcome anything that threatens it will be something we fear the fear of losing control underpins stress for example and creates frustration over what cant be controlled as desirable as it is to be in a position of control our attachment to it ultimately creates a fear that can manifest as stress worry anxiety and panic advertisement learn more fear brings disorder into our experience when it is within us and its an energy that suppresses consciousness activation energy is the force required to get you from doing something when youre on autopilot such as habits routines procedural awareness or relaxing to doing something new it is a manifestation of willpower when we are in a state of fear stress our activation energy is diverted toward doing things to ourselves that are primarily against our will running late for work and caught in a traffic jam you can either become frustrated and upset because you fear arriving to work late which brings you no closer to your goal of getting there on time or you can accept the present moment and use it as a learning lesson to leave earlier next time you can also choose to enjoy the unexpected free time in the morning and listen to a podcast or some music there are many choices you can make in that space of time that can affect or degrade even the most minute increments of your personal development stress causes you to divert attention and willpower away from your initial goal bringing you no closer to it than when you began in a state of stress and fear your willpower gets diverted toward the threat not the goal and this is against your own best interest time is currency so pay attention to what you spend your time on advertisement learn more now of course there are valid situations where your willpower must be diverted toward dealing with the threat or there might not be any willpower left for you to use in the future there are two types of fear survival based fear and ego based fear ego fear includes fear of rejection failure humiliation loss uncertainty lack of control etc these fears are not real but may feel so to you ask yourself whats the worst that could happen is it death the loss of freedom a loved one suffering if its none of those then youre too attached to an outcome that is not essential to your wholeness when were mindful of our awareness extraordinary things await us on the opposite side of fear believe believe in what yourself a higher power both believe in the truth of your situation by first accepting everything that is happening you cant move forward in a state of denial because denial is resistance then think about what youre afraid of an outcome for example and why it is making you feel afraid what will you lose that is causing your anxiety what is this thing that youre holding onto that is vital to your security and wholeness fear should be an alarm not a program an alarm alerts you of danger while a program controls and runs the show when alerted by fear we can use the logic of our conscious mind to analyze if we are in any real danger rather than allowing the subconscious mind and its primal instincts to impulsively control us even if we dont lash out during times of stress and frustration we may remain divided and chaotic internally throwing emotional temper tantrums no one else sees do your job to parent yourself and take control of the inner child embedded in your subconscious mind we all have one fear is an insecurity and insecurity is the source of many malfunctions in the human condition however if it wasnt for fear we would never know who and what we really are fear is illusion life is designed to strip illusion from you by bringing you face to face with your fears again and again until you have no choice but to face them release resistance to them and become fearless once you become fearless youre free from illusion because you have discovered the truth of whats on the other side of your fear we design our lives to run away from fear so we dont have to feel it but whatever we resist persists chasing us into the corner its understandable why we do this but its not helpful because this daunting tool that keeps offering itself to us is the tool of our expansion the tool of truth if we are ready to accept it you would be oblivious to yourself without fear which makes it one of the greatest tools of awareness you shouldnt feel ashamed of it regardless of how tough you are every human being feels fear people who suppress fear are glorified rather than suppress it feel it and come to terms with it this way you wont feel the need to suppress it because you have already gotten to its source truth and the truth will always wipe out fear by suppressing fear youre ignoring your personal lesson we often ignore what our emotional guidance system is trying to tell us because we dont think fear is valid fear is a red flag within us that we should pay closer attention to so we can dig deep and find the source of that fear suppressing it is only ignoring the shadow masking it as courage we dont examine the fear that we have instead we try to focus on anything that decreases the level of fear that we experience sometimes fear is legitimate and sometimes it is not but we must always pay attention to it so we can get to the truth of why its there fear of the unknown is also common since we know nothing about the unkown what we actually fear is whatever we ourselves project into it we think we know what potential negative thing the unknown might hold for us and we are running from the projection of that potential pain we fear what we project into the unknown based on our previous experiences mostly from childhood of uncertainty and discomfort the reptile brain seeks comfort so anything that is uncomfortable alerts our primal survival drives these red flags create anxious moments to our pleasureseeking and painavoiding ego when faced with the unknown the mind goes to work projecting its already acquired fears into the unknown so that it can predict what lies there its those projections that we fear its not the unknown of that experience that it fears its what it thinks it knows that experience will create we need to be brave enough to face and admit to what we actually fear this may sound counterintuitive but everything we do regardless of how stupid or damaging it is for ourselves has a positive intention at its core anxiety responses aim to help us usually to get us out of a situation to protect us every behaviour that we generate even if its detrimental to our longterm growth and happiness has a positive intention behind it and recognizing this will allow you to change the behaviour your subconscious mind wants to protect you but it doesnt think longterm with respect to your growth and happiness it reacts in the present moment and wants to deal with the perceived danger now the subconscious is always thinking about whats happening now and how to fix it now it thinks how do i get out of it how do i survive it while your subconscious mind is intuitive smart and integral to the mindbody system it is also deeply irrational and has the cognitive capacity of a yearold child ask yourself would you let a yearold run your life we need to educate and guide the subconscious mind using its own language and worldview the subconscious minds job is to keep you happy healthy and safe so when you give it a way to understand that what its doing is hurting you it will stop the behaviour if the subconscious mind has to choose between safety and happiness it will always chose safety selfpreservation is its primary objective to protect you and keep you alive so you can move your genes forward do not justify your fear while something could have happened to you that created the fear such as a traumatic event you must still move beyond it it may be difficult but when you justify your fear in whatever terms you remain a prisoner to it you give yourself a reason to hold onto the fear because youre telling yourself that this fear is coming from the outside instead of its true source the inside once you become aware of something you have the choice and power to change it your belief systems determine your ability to overcome your fears if you tell yourself i cant overcome this fear you ensure this remains true as long as you believe it it will be true in your reality the perception we have of ourselves is greater than the perception other people have of us your perceptions will determine how you will react which in turn determines how long the fear will last in your life facing your greatest fears will be your greatest liberation your fears are your unresolved issues once you get to the truth of why they exist you can resolve those issues and stop feeding the fears we must let go of and reexamine what we think is good and bad because our perspective shapes our fears \\nthe sacred science follows eight people from around the world with varying

       "5065  CAN IT GET MORE CORRUPT? Bill That Bans Naming Officers Involved in Shootings Goes to Pennsylvania Governor. Editor’s Note : Disgusting. This country just gets more and more corrupt by the day… it’s insane. Pretty soon it will collapse of its own weight under so much disgusting corruption.\\n\\nThe Pennsylvania legislature has passed a law prohibiting the release of officers’ names for up to 30 days after a police-related death has occurred. It was backed by Philadelphia police unions and will become law if signed by Democratic Governor Tom Wolf.\\nThe measure passed Thursday after the Republican-controlled legislature voted along party lines. If the bill becomes law, it will prevent public officials from releasing the names of officers involved in shootings which cause death or “ serious bodily injury ” for up to 30 days after the incident, or until the conclusion of an official investigation.\\nThe bill, HB 1538, was sponsored by state Rep. Martina White (R-Philadelphia) and is a direct contradiction of the Philadelphia Police Department’s policy of releasing names within 72 hours of a shooting.\\nThe 72-hour rule was created by the Department of Justice and put into place by former police commissioner Charles H. Ramsey in 2014, after it was recommended. Speaking in support of the rule at the time, Ramsey said : “ I don’t think you can reasonably expect to shoot people and remain anonymous. ”\\nHowever, the influential Philadelphia Police Union has defended HB 1538.\\n“ We’re just asking to put a lid on the boiling pot until things calm down, especially if it’s an investigation that could lead to protests in the community, ” John McNesby, president of the 14,500-strong union, told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.\\nWhite claims the bill is needed, due to the dangers faced by police officers\\n“ I was watching the television and just saw how officers are being gunned down and other officers in different states had been subjected to harassment and the very things that they are trying to protect citizens like ourselves from experiencing, and to me the 72-hour rule is really just an arbitrary number, ” White told the Post-Gazette.\\nHowever, neither McNesby nor White could identify any instances of officers or their families being harmed due to being publicly identified.\\nMcNesby told the Post-Gazette that he was unaware of any direct threats that had taken place, but said “ that’s what we’re looking to stop before it becomes a reality. ”\\nThe American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania has criticized the bill, calling it “ a policy that will heighten tensions between the police and the communities they serve” and accusing it of being “completely tone deaf to the needs of communities that are impacted by police brutality. ”\\nRep. Margo Davidson (D-Delaware County) has also spoken out against the bill, saying it undermines “ the bridges that have been built between law enforcement and communities of color. ” She added that “ this legislation will do nothing but breed suspicion. ”\\nDavidson, along with many other Philadelphia Democrats, opposed the bill in the 151-32 vote.\\nGovernor Wolf has yet to comment on whether or not he will sign the bill, which passed the Senate and House with a veto-proof majority. If Wolf still decides to veto, an override of that veto would only be able to take place after the next election.\\n\\nRead Also: War on Cops Debunked: More Cops Died by Accident Than Violence in 2015

       "1320  Magnificent Jellyfish Gardens Purify The Water While Growing Food. These Jellyfish Lodges are capable of purifying waterways, collecting discarded trash, and even growing nutritious food! By Amanda Froelich \\nIntriguing eco-friendly innovations are unveiled all the time, but the floating Jellyfish Lodge is probably unlike anything you’ve ever seen before. In addition to being aesthetically appealing, the lodges can purify the land, air, and water and grow nourishing food.\\nDesigner Janine Hung relays that the structures combine trash-collecting tentacles, aquaponic gardens, and a filtration system that all work to benefit the environment.\\n\\nThe solar-powered lodges utilize aquaponic technology to grow fruits and vegetables while cleaning the air with an electrostatic system. Each structure features and interior garden that thrives by filtering polluted water. Additionally, long tentacle arms which appear similar to a jellyfish’s collect drifting trash without harming wildlife.\\nUnfortunately, it’s not likely this design will be realized, as it only received an Honorable Mention award in this year’s Biodesign Competition , reports Inhabitat . However, it’s so neat we figured the concept needed to be shared.\\n\\n\\nAn intriguing feature of the lodge is that it can test water for toxicity and start the process of treating water through a unique microbial digestion chamber. Once the water is purified, it can be returned to the surrounding environment.\\nIf these structures are eventually created, they’d ideally be maintained by nearby residents who could utilize the foods in their holistic kitchens .\\n\\nHung hopes that the Jellyfish Lodges are eventually constructed to serve as a solution to problems plaguing the world’s waterways, including acidification and pollution .\\nImage Credit: Janine Hung \\nSource: True Activist \\n

       "1870  Anti-War Movement Anticipates More War Under A Clinton Presidency. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton speaks during a news conference at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, December 5, 2012.\\nNEW YORK — As the bizarre 2016 presidential election nears its end, activists in the United States are considering the prospects for war and peace under the next administration.\\nAnd with Hillary Clinton leading comfortably in most polls, the Democratic nominee’s militaristic record, as well as her promises to expand the use of force, are sparking concern.\\n“Clinton is one of the biggest war-mongers the country has,” Joe Lombardo, co-coordinator of the United National Antiwar Coalition , told MintPress News.\\n“She pushed for the bombing of Libya and the regime change in that country. She has supported a no-fly zone in Syria, which can put the U.S. in direct conflict with Russia.”\\nOn the campaign trail, Clinton has repeatedly advocated a “no-fly zone” in Syria, an aggressive move necessarily accompanied by a widespread bombing campaign, similar to those in Iraq and Libya, which were followed by expanded interventions to impose regime change.\\nSenior U.S. military pilots have warned that the proposal could plunge the United States into direct conflict with Russia, whose air force is currently deployed over Syria.\\nIn September, Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the Senate that the prospect “requires us to go to war against Syria and Russia.”\\n‘Kill a lot of Syrians’ “It is critical that we not be confused about what Clinton’s promise of a no-fly zone will mean,” Meredith Aby of the Minneapolis-based Anti-War Committee told MintPress.\\n“It is an escalation of U.S. involvement in the Syrian civil war and it will mean an increase in casualties.”\\nIn 2013, Clinton herself admitted in a paid speech to Goldman Sachs, obtained and released by WikiLeaks in September, that her proposal would “kill a lot of Syrians.”\\n“To have a no-fly zone you have to take out all of the air defense, many of which are located in populated areas,” she said.\\nBeyond Syria, Clinton has also threatened to attack and “totally obliterate” Iran , and she has repeatedly promised to take the United States’ ties with Israel “to the next level.”\\nIn August, after accusing Russia and China of hacking U.S. computer systems, she warned : “We will be ready with serious political, economic and military responses.”\\n‘A voice for war since 2002’ US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, left, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu talk in Jerusalem, Israel, Monday, July 16, 2012.\\nThese statements, along with Clinton’s long, unbroken record of supporting military interventions, have anti-war activists eying the future warily.\\n“Many in the anti-war movement understand the dangers of a Clinton presidency,” Aby said.\\n“From her resume it is fairly obvious she will be a hawk, more so than President Obama and President Clinton. She has been a voice for war since 2002 when she voted for war in Iraq.”\\nBeyond Clinton’s explicit threats of wars, her administration may also seek to expand the use of “soft power,” ranging from diplomatic assistance and military aid to subversion and coups, in pursuit of its foreign policy goals.\\n“She has called for boosting U.S. support for Israeli missile defense systems and supports helping Israel with technology to fight in Gaza,” Aby said, adding:\\n“On the campaign trail, she has denounced the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement as a threat to Israel. And while she hasn’t campaigned on it, she is no friend of Latin America. Her own emails show the role she played in helping provide support for the coup in Honduras.”\\nLombardo also noted that regions further removed from the headlines than flashpoints like Syria could face similar threats from a Hillary Clinton administration.\\n“The Philippines is heating up and Clinton has a history in Latin America, where there are many places that the U.S. would like to see regime change,” he said.\\n‘A very unpopular president from day one’ In the waning months of the campaign, both Clinton and her Republican rival, Donald Trump, have emerged as historically unpopular candidates , more so than others in the era of scientific polling.\\nIndeed, while Trump’s aggression has kept his popularity below Clinton’s, she recently surpassed the bellicose billionaire as the least-liked candidate in history.\\nA poll released by ABC News and the Washington Post on Tuesday showed Clinton’s unpopularity had reached a record-breaking 60 percent, while Trump’s stood at 58 percent.\\nDespite her jingoism and promises to expand U.S. military efforts far beyond those of Barack Obama, organizers hope this public disdain may give them room to maneuver.\\n“Although Clinton will win the presidency, she will be a very unpopular president from day one, which will give us the political space to organize opposition to her foreign policy,” Aby said.\\nLombardo agreed. “Clinton is very unpopular, and while the election of Obama put a damper on the anti-war movement, I believe we will see that turn around under Clinton.”\\nHe also noted the growth of domestic social movements, like Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter, that could herald a resurgence in mobilization.\\n“There is a downturn in the economy, distrust of the government and the system as a whole,” Lombardo said. “The connections with the wars abroad and the wars at home is clear to more and more people. I think a movement against increased war can be explosive and powerful during a Clinton administration.”\\nBut he added that there was much work to be done. “Although anti-war sentiment in the U.S. is high, the anti-war movement in weak compared to where it was in the past.”\\n‘No optimism, only apprehension’ A woman with the words “hands off” painted on her face takes part in a protest organized by the Stop the War coalition calling for no military attack on Syria from the U.S., Britain or France, across the road from the entrance of Downing Street in London, Wednesday, Aug. 28, 2013.\\nAs the clock ticks down to the election, numerous organizations have launched new efforts they hope will preempt the war drive expected to start soon after Jan. 20.\\nAlong with other groups and individual supporters, the United National Antiwar Coalition launched a “Hands Off Syria Coalition” and accompanying statement against further U.S. intervention in the war-torn country.\\nThe effort “is getting a tremendous response,” Lombardo said.\\nOther organizations, including the ANSWER Coalition and International Action Center , have called for protests against the inauguration in Washington.\\n“There’s no optimism, only apprehension,” International Action Center co-director Sara Flounders told MintPress. “People know in their bones that a larger war is coming. From the first day of a new administration, we need to send an angry warning.”\\nBut with the United States fatigued from a grueling election season that has left few residents with positive impressions of either candidate, widespread distrust of the political system may deny the new president the mandate he or she would need to embark on new military adventures.\\n“I think people are less naive now then they were eight years ago,” Aby said. “People understand that foreign policy is not an issue that truly separates the two major party candidates.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "610   How To Reduce Stress. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter The root cause of stress is fear, as all fear is the threat of losing our attachments. If we’re attached to a desired outcome, anything that threatens it will be something we fear. The fear of losing control underpins stress, for example, and creates frustration over what can’t be controlled. As desirable as it is to be in a position of control, our attachment to it ultimately creates a fear that can manifest as stress, worry, anxiety, and panic. advertisement - learn more Fear brings disorder into our experience when it is within us, and it’s an energy that suppresses consciousness. Activation energy is the force required to get you from doing something when you’re on autopilot (such as habits, routines, procedural awareness, or relaxing) to doing something new. It is a manifestation of willpower. When we are in a state of fear (stress), our activation energy is diverted toward doing things to ourselves that are primarily against our will. Running late for work and caught in a traffic jam? You can either become frustrated and upset because you fear arriving to work late (which brings you no closer to your goal of getting there on time), or you can accept the present moment and use it as a learning lesson to leave earlier next time. You can also choose to enjoy the unexpected free time in the morning and listen to a podcast or some music. There are many choices you can make in that space of time that can affect or degrade even the most minute increments of your personal development. Stress causes you to divert attention and willpower away from your initial goal, bringing you no closer to it than when you began. In a state of stress and fear, your willpower gets diverted toward the threat, not the goal, and this is against your own best interest. Time is currency, so pay attention to what you spend your time on. advertisement - learn more Now of course there are valid situations where your willpower MUST be diverted toward dealing with the threat or there might not be any willpower left for you to use in the future! There are two types of fear: survival based fear and ego based fear. Ego fear includes fear of rejection, failure, humiliation, loss, uncertainty, lack of control, etc. These fears are not real, but may feel so to you. Ask yourself, what’s the worst that could happen? Is it death, the loss of freedom, a loved one suffering? If it’s none of those then you’re too attached to an outcome that is not essential to your wholeness. When we’re mindful of our awareness, extraordinary things await us on the opposite side of fear. Believe. Believe in what? Yourself? A higher power? Both? Believe in the truth of your situation by first accepting everything that is happening. You can’t move forward in a state of denial because denial is resistance. Then think about what you’re afraid of (an outcome, for example) and why it is making you feel afraid. What will you lose that is causing your anxiety? What is this thing that you’re holding onto that is vital to your security and wholeness? Fear should be an alarm, not a program. An alarm alerts you of danger, while a program controls and runs the show. When ALERTED by fear we can use the logic of our conscious mind to analyze if we are in any real danger, rather than allowing the subconscious mind and its primal instincts to impulsively control us. Even if we don’t lash out during times of stress and frustration, we may remain divided and chaotic internally, throwing emotional temper tantrums no one else sees. Do your job to parent yourself and take control of the inner child embedded in your subconscious mind (we all have one). Fear is an insecurity, and insecurity is the source of many malfunctions in the human condition. However, if it wasn’t for fear, we would never know who and what we really are. Fear is illusion. Life is designed to strip illusion from you by bringing you face to face with your fears again and again until you have no choice but to face them, release resistance to them, and become fearless. Once you become fearless you’re free from illusion because you have discovered the truth of what’s on the other side of your fear. We design our lives to run away from fear so we don’t have to feel it, but whatever we resist persists, chasing us into the corner. It’s understandable why we do this but it’s not helpful because this daunting tool that keeps offering itself to us is the tool of our expansion, the tool of truth if we are ready to accept it. You would be oblivious to yourself without fear, which makes it one of the greatest tools of awareness. You shouldn’t feel ashamed of it; regardless of how tough you are, every human being feels fear. People who suppress fear are glorified. Rather than suppress it, feel it and come to terms with it. This way you won’t feel the need to suppress it because you have already gotten to its source: truth. And the truth will always wipe out fear. By suppressing fear you’re ignoring your personal lesson. We often ignore what our emotional guidance system is trying to tell us because we don’t think fear is valid. Fear is a red flag within us that we should pay closer attention to so we can dig deep and find the source of that fear. Suppressing it is only ignoring the shadow, masking it as courage. We don’t examine the fear that we have; instead, we try to focus on anything that decreases the level of fear that we experience. Sometimes fear is legitimate and sometimes it is not, but we must always pay attention to it so we can get to the Truth of why it’s there. Fear of the unknown is also common. Since we know nothing about the unkown, what we actually fear is whatever we ourselves project into it. We think we know what potential negative thing the unknown might hold for us and we are running from the projection of that potential pain. We fear what we project into the unknown based on our previous experiences (mostly from childhood) of uncertainty and discomfort. The reptile brain seeks comfort, so anything that is uncomfortable alerts our primal survival drives. These red flags create anxious moments to our pleasure-seeking and pain-avoiding ego. When faced with the unknown, the mind goes to work projecting its already acquired fears into the unknown so that it can predict what lies there. It’s those projections that we fear. It’s not the unknown of that experience that it fears, it’s what it thinks it knows that experience will create. We need to be brave enough to face and admit to what we actually fear. This may sound counterintuitive, but everything we do, regardless of how stupid or damaging it is for ourselves, has a positive intention at its core. Anxiety responses aim to help us — usually to get us out of a situation, to protect us. Every behaviour that we generate, even if it’s detrimental to our long-term growth and happiness, has a positive intention behind it, and recognizing this will allow you to change the behaviour. Your subconscious mind wants to protect you but it doesn’t think long-term with respect to your growth and happiness; it reacts in the present moment, and wants to deal with the perceived danger NOW. The subconscious is always thinking about what’s happening now, and how to fix it now. It thinks, “How do I get out of it? How do I survive it?” While your subconscious mind is intuitive, smart, and integral to the mind-body system, it is also deeply irrational and has the cognitive capacity of a 10-year-old child. Ask yourself, would you let a 10-year-old run your life? We need to educate and guide the subconscious mind using its own language and worldview. The subconscious mind’s job is to keep you happy, healthy, and safe, so when you give it a way to understand that what it’s doing is hurting you, it will stop the behaviour. If the subconscious mind has to choose between safety and happiness, it will always chose safety. Self-preservation is its primary objective, to protect you and keep you alive so you can move your genes forward. Do not justify your fear. While something could have happened to you that created the fear, such as a traumatic event, you must still move beyond it. It may be difficult, but when you justify your fear, in whatever terms, you remain a prisoner to it. You give yourself a reason to hold onto the fear because you’re telling yourself that this fear is coming from the outside instead of its true source, the inside. Once you become aware of something, you have the choice and power to change it. Your belief systems determine your ability to overcome your fears. If you tell yourself, “I can’t overcome this fear,” you ensure this remains true. As long as you believe it, it will be True in your reality. The perception we have of ourselves is greater than the perception other people have of us. Your perceptions will determine how you will react, which in turn determines how long the fear will last in your life. Facing your greatest fears will be your greatest liberation. Your fears are your unresolved issues; once you get to the Truth of why they exist, you can resolve those issues and stop feeding the fears. We must let go of and reexamine what we think is good and bad because our perspective shapes our fears. \\nThe Sacred Science follows eight people from around the world, with varying physical and psychological illnesses, as they embark on a one-month healing journey into the heart of the Amazon jungle. \\nYou can watch this documentary film FREE for 10 days by clicking here. \\n\"If “Survivor” was actually real and had stakes worth caring about, it would be what happens here, and “The Sacred Science” hopefully is merely one in a long line of exciting endeavors from this group.\" - Billy Okeefe, McClatchy Tribune  \n",
       "4014  Clinton commits Benghazi gaffe, saying US 'didn't lose a single person' in Libya. Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton committed her second gaffe in as many days on the campaign trail Monday night, claiming that the U.S. \"didn't lose a single person\" in Libya during her time as secretary of state.\\n\\nClinton made the comment defending her push for regime change in the war-torn North African nation at an Illinois town hall hosted by MSNBC.\\n\\n\"Now, is Libya perfect? It isn't,\" Clinton said. After contrasting her approach toward Libya with the ongoing bloodshed in Syria's civil war, Clinton said \"Libya was a different kind of calculation and we didn't lose a single person ... We didn’t have a problem in supporting our European and Arab allies in working with NATO.\"\\n\\nClinton made no mention of the Sept. 11, 2012 terror attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya that killed four Americans: U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens, information officer Sean Smith, and former Navy SEALS Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty.\\n\\nQuestions about the attack and its aftermath have dogged Clinton throughout her second run for the White House, with emails released by the State Department contradicting several aspects of her testimony before the House Select Committee investigating the attack.\\n\\nEarlier Monday, Clinton's campaign was forced to scramble to clarify comments she made about coal jobs at a CNN town hall Sunday night.\\n\\n\"I'm the only candidate which has a policy about how to bring economic opportunity using clean renewable energy as the key into coal country,\" Clinton said, \"because we're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.\"\\n\\nWith many workers in crucial primary states like Ohio and Illinois relying on such jobs, Clinton's campaign put out a statement stressing that, “Coal will remain a part of the energy mix for years to come” and Clinton’s plan would also safeguard workers’ retirement and health benefits.\\n\\nSpokesman Brian Fallon said “no candidate in this race is more devoted to supporting coal communities than Hillary Clinton” and “any suggestions otherwise are false.\"

       "      <td>daniel greenfield a shillman journalism fellow at the freedom center is a new york writer focusing on radical islam \\nin the final stretch of the election hillary rodham clinton has gone to war with the fbi \\nthe word unprecedented has been thrown around so often this election that it ought to be retired but its still unprecedented for the nominee of a major political party to go war with the fbi \\nbut thats exactly what hillary and her people have done coma patients just waking up now and watching an hour of cnn from their hospital beds would assume that fbi director james comey is hillarys opponent in this election \\nthe fbi is under attack by everyone from obama to cnn hillarys people have circulated a letter attacking comey there are currently more media hit pieces lambasting him than targeting trump it wouldnt be too surprising if the clintons or their allies were to start running attack ads against the fbi \\nthe fbis leadership is being warned that the entire leftwing establishment will form a lynch mob if they continue going after hillary and the fbis credibility is being attacked by the media and the democrats to preemptively head off the results of the investigation of the clinton foundation and hillary clinton \\nthe covert struggle between fbi agents and obamas doj people has gone explosively public \\nthe new york times has compared comey to j edgar hoover its bizarre headline james comey role recalls hoovers fbi fairly or not practically admits up front that its spouting nonsense the boston globe has published a column calling for comeys resignation not to be outdone time has an editorial claiming that the scandal is really an attack on all women \\njames carville appeared on msnbc to remind everyone that he was still alive and insane he accused comey of coordinating with house republicans and the kgb and you thought the vast right wing conspiracy was a stretch \\ncountless media stories charge comey with violating procedure do you know whats a procedural violation emailing classified information stored on your bathroom server \\nsenator harry reid has sent comey a letter accusing him of violating the hatch act the hatch act is a nice idea that has as much relevance in the age of obama as the tenth amendment but the cable news spectrum quickly filled with media hacks glancing at the wikipedia article on the hatch act under the table while accusing the fbi director of one of the most awkward conspiracies against hillary ever \\nif james comey is really out to hurt hillary he picked one hell of a strange way to do it \\nnot too long ago democrats were breathing a sigh of relief when he gave hillary clinton a pass in a prominent public statement if he really were out to elect trump by keeping the email scandal going why did he trash the investigation was he on the payroll of house republicans and the kgb back then and playing it coy or was it a sudden development where vladimir putin and paul ryan talked him into taking a look at anthony weiners computer \\neither comey is the most cunning fbi director that ever lived or hes just awkwardly trying to navigate a political mess that has trapped him between a doj leadership whose political futures are tied to hillarys victory and his own bureau whose apolitical agents just want to be allowed to do their jobs \\nthe only truly mysterious thing is why hillary and her associates decided to go to war with a respected federal agency most americans like the fbi while hillary clinton enjoys a  unfavorable rating \\nand its an interesting question \\nhillarys old strategy was to lie and deny that the fbi even had a criminal investigation underway instead her associates insisted that it was a security review the fbi corrected her and she shrugged it off but the old breezy denial approach has given way to a savage assault on the fbi \\npretending that nothing was wrong was a bad strategy but it was a better one that picking a fight with the fbi while lunatic clinton associates try to claim that the fbi is really the kgb \\nthere are two possible explanations \\nhillary clinton might be arrogant enough to lash out at the fbi now that she believes that victory is near the same kind of hubris that led her to plan her victory fireworks display could lead her to declare a war on the fbi for irritating her during the final miles of her campaign \\nbut the other explanation is that her people panicked \\ngoing to war with the fbi is not the behavior of a smart and focused presidential campaign its an act of desperation when a presidential candidate decides that her only option is to try and destroy the credibility of the fbi thats not hubris its fear of what the fbi might be about to reveal about her \\nduring the original fbi investigation hillary clinton was confident that she could ride it out and she had good reason for believing that but that hillary clinton is gone in her place is a paranoid wreck within a short space of time the positive clinton campaign promising to unite the country has been replaced by a desperate and flailing operation that has focused all its energy on fighting the fbi \\ntheres only one reason for such bizarre behavior \\nthe clinton campaign has decided that an fbi investigation of the latest batch of emails poses a threat to its survival and so its gone all in on fighting the fbi its an unprecedented step born of fear its hard to know whether that fear is justified but the existence of that fear already tells us a whole lot \\nclinton loyalists rigged the old investigation they knew the outcome ahead of time as well as they knew the debate questions now suddenly they are no longer in control and they are afraid \\nyou can smell the fear \\nthe fbi has wiretaps from the investigation of the clinton foundation its finding new emails all the time and clintonworld panicked the spinmeisters of clintonworld have claimed that the email scandal is just so much smoke without fire all thats here is the appearance of impropriety without any of the substance but this isnt how you react to smoke its how you respond to a fire \\nthe misguided assault on the fbi tells us that hillary clinton and her allies are afraid of a revelation bigger than the fundamental illegality of her email setup the email setup was a preemptive cover up the clinton campaign has panicked badly out of the belief right or wrong that whatever crime the illegal setup was meant to cover up is at risk of being exposed \\nthe clintons have weathered countless scandals over the years whatever they are protecting this time around is bigger than the usual corruption bribery sexual assaults and abuses of power that have followed them around throughout the years this is bigger and more damaging than any of the allegations that have already come out and they dont want fbi investigators anywhere near it \\nthe campaign against comey is pure intimidation its also a warning any senior fbi people who value their careers are being warned to stay away the democrats are closing ranks around their nominee against the fbi its an ugly and unprecedented scene it may also be their last stand \\nhillary clinton has awkwardly wound her way through numerous scandals in just this election cycle but shes never shown fear or desperation before now that has changed whatever she is afraid of it lies buried in her emails with huma abedin and it can bring her down like nothing else has</td>\n",

fbi investigation hillary clinton was confident that she could ride it out and she had good reason for believing that but that hillary clinton is gone in her place is a paranoid wreck within a short

\\nbut thats exactly what hillary and her people have done coma patients just waking   now and watching   hour   cnn from their hospital beds would assume that fbi director james comey   hillarys opponent   this election \\nthe fbi   under attack   everyone from obama   cnn hillarys people have circulated   letter attacking comey there are currently more media hit pieces lambasting him than targeting trump   wouldnt   too surprising   the clintons   their allies were   start running attack ads against the fbi \\nthe fbis leadership   being warned that the entire leftwing establishment will form   lynch mob   they continue going after hillary and the fbis credibility   being attacked   the media and the democrats   preemptively head off the results   the investigation   the clinton foundation and hillary clinton \\nthe covert struggle between fbi agents and obamas doj people has gone explosively public \\nthe new york times has compared comey     edgar hoover its bizarre headline james comey role recalls hoovers fbi fairly   not practically admits   front that its spouting nonsense the boston globe has published   column calling for comeys resignation not     outdone time has   editorial claiming that the scandal   really   attack   all women \\njames carville appeared   msnbc   remind everyone that   was still alive and insane   accused comey   coordinating with house republicans and the kgb and you thought the vast right wing conspiracy was   stretch \\ncountless media stories charge comey with violating procedure   you know whats   procedural violation emailing classified information stored   your bathroom server \\nsenator harry reid has sent comey   letter accusing him   violating the hatch act the hatch act     nice idea that has   much relevance   the age   obama   the tenth amendment but the cable news spectrum quickly filled with media hacks glancing   the wikipedia article   the hatch act under the table while accusing the fbi director   one   the most awkward conspiracies against hillary ever \\n  james comey   really out   hurt hillary   picked one hell     strange way       \\nnot too long ago democrats were breathing   sigh   relief when   gave hillary clinton   pass     prominent public statement     really were out   elect trump   keeping the email scandal going why did   trash the investigation was     the payroll   house republicans and the kgb back then and playing   coy   was     sudden development where vladimir putin and paul ryan talked him into taking   look   anthony weiners computer \\neither comey   the most cunning fbi director that ever lived   hes just awkwardly trying   navigate   political mess that has trapped him between   doj leadership whose political futures are tied   hillarys victory and his own bureau whose apolitical agents just want     allowed     their jobs \\nthe only truly mysterious thing   why hillary and her associates decided       war with   respected federal agency most americans like the fbi while hillary clinton enjoys    unfavorable rating \\nand its   interesting question \\nhillarys old strategy was   lie and deny that the fbi even had   criminal investigation underway instead her associates insisted that   was   security review the fbi corrected her and she shrugged   off but the old breezy denial approach has given way     savage assault   the fbi \\npretending that nothing was wrong was   bad strategy but   was   better one that picking   fight with the fbi while lunatic clinton associates try   claim that the fbi   really the kgb \\nthere are two possible explanations \\nhillary clinton might   arrogant enough   lash out   the fbi now that she believes that victory   near the same kind   hubris that led her   plan her victory fireworks display could lead her   declare   war   the fbi for irritating her during the final miles   her campaign \\nbut the other explanation   that her people panicked \\ngoing   war with the fbi   not the behavior     smart and focused presidential campaign its   act   desperation when   presidential candidate decides that her only option     try and destroy the credibility   the fbi thats not hubris its fear   what the fbi might   about   reveal about her \\nduring the original fbi investigation hillary clinton was confident that she could ride   out and she had good reason for believing that but that hillary clinton   gone   her place     paranoid wreck within   short space   time the positive clinton campaign promising   unite the country has been replaced     desperate and flailing operation that has focused all its energy   fighting the fbi \\ntheres only one reason for such bizarre behavior \\nthe clinton campaign has decided that   fbi investigation   the latest batch   emails poses   threat   its survival and   its gone all     fighting the fbi its   unprecedented step born   fear its hard   know whether that fear   justified but the existence   that fear already tells     whole lot \\nclinton loyalists rigged the old investigation they knew the outcome ahead   time   well   they knew the debate questions now suddenly they are   longer   control and they are afraid \\nyou can smell the fear \\nthe fbi has wiretaps from the investigation   the clinton foundation its finding new emails all the time and clintonworld panicked the spinmeisters   clintonworld have claimed that the email scandal   just   much smoke without fire all thats here   the appearance   impropriety without any   the substance but this isnt how you react   smoke its how you respond     fire \\nthe misguided assault   the fbi tells   that hillary clinton and her allies are afraid     revelation bigger than the fundamental illegality   her email setup the email setup was   preemptive cover   the clinton campaign has panicked badly out   the belief right   wrong that whatever crime the illegal setup was meant   cover       risk   being exposed \\nthe clintons have weathered countless scandals over the years whatever they are protecting this time around   bigger than the usual corruption bribery sexual assaults and abuses   power that have followed them around throughout the years this   bigger and more damaging than any   the allegations that have already come out and they dont want fbi investigators anywhere near   \\nthe campaign against comey   pure intimidation its also   warning any senior fbi people who value their careers are being warned   stay away the democrats are closing ranks around their nominee against the fbi its   ugly and unprecedented scene   may also   their last stand \\nhillary clinton has awkwardly wound her way through numerous scandals   just this election cycle but shes never shown fear   desperation before now that has changed whatever she   afraid     lies buried   her emails with huma abedin and   can bring her down like nothing else has    \n",
